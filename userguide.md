## Overview

Financial Foundations is a free, self-paced educational website for anyone wanting to build knowledge of the finance industry. It combines written explanations with embedded videos across seven topic areas, from the basics of banking through to complex derivatives, regulation, and risk management. No account or login is required.

---

## Getting Started

Open the website in any modern browser. You will land on the homepage, which displays a welcome message and a navigation menu at the top of the page. The menu lists all seven sections of the course. You can either click a section name in the menu to jump directly to it, or simply scroll down the page to read through all sections in order.

There is no mandatory sequence — you can jump to any topic at any time.

---

## Navigating the Sections

Each section is labelled and numbered in the navigation menu and on the page itself. The seven sections are:

1. Financial Markets
2. Equity Trading
3. Fixed Income
4. Derivatives
5. Currency and Foreign Exchange
6. Treasury
7. Regulation and Risk

Clicking a section name in the navigation menu scrolls the page to the start of that section. To return to the top of the page, scroll up manually or use your browser's scroll-to-top shortcut.

---

## Using the Video Content

Each section opens with one or more embedded videos. The video appears at the top of the section, above the written content. To watch a video, simply click the play button. Videos are hosted externally and will play directly in the page.

The written content for each section sits below its video. This layout is intentional — the site recommends watching the video first and then reading the text for a deeper explanation of the same topics.

---

## Reading the Written Content

Each section is broken into clearly headed subsections. You can read them in order or use your browser's in-page search function (`Ctrl+F` on Windows, `Cmd+F` on Mac) to find a specific term or topic quickly. All key terms are bolded when they are first defined, making it easy to scan for definitions as you read.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of the Site

- **Watch before you read.** Each section's video gives a high-level overview; the written content beneath goes deeper into the same topics.
- **Use in-page search.** Press `Ctrl+F` (or `Cmd+F` on Mac) to search for a specific term. All key terms are bolded and defined throughout the text.
- **Follow the order if you're new to finance.** Later sections assume familiarity with concepts introduced earlier.
- **Skip ahead if you have existing knowledge.** Each section is self-contained enough to be read independently, so feel free to jump to whatever is most relevant to you.
- **Take your own notes.** The site doesn't include quizzes or exercises, so keeping notes as you go is the best way to reinforce what you learn.

## Technical Notes

The website works in any up-to-date browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No plugins, downloads, or accounts are needed. If a video does not load, check that your browser allows embedded video content and that you have an active internet connection. The written content will remain fully accessible even if a video fails to play.
