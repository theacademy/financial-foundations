   - **Click any section name** in the top navigation menu to jump directly to that topic.

> **Note:** No account, login, or software download is needed. The site works entirely in your browser.

The navigation menu at the top of the page lists all seven sections. Clicking a section name scrolls the page directly to that section.

| # | Section |
|---|---|

| 2 | Equity Trading |
| 3 | Fixed Income |
| 4 | Derivatives |

## Watching Video Content

Each section begins with one or more **embedded videos** that provide a high-level overview of the topic.

**To watch a video:**
1. Scroll to the section you want.
2. Click the **play button** on the video player at the top of the section.
3. The video plays directly in the page — no external site or app will open.

> **Recommended:** Watch the video first, then read the written content below it. The video gives you a broad picture; the text goes deeper into the same concepts.

**If a video doesn't load:**
- Check that your browser allows embedded video content (look for a blocked content notification in your address bar).
- Confirm you have an active internet connection.
- Try refreshing the page.
- The written content remains fully accessible even if a video fails to play.

---

## Reading Written Content

Each section's written content is organised into clearly headed subsections and sits directly below the video player.

**Useful reading tips:**

- **Search for a specific term** using your browser's in-page search:
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + F`
  - Mac: `Cmd + F`
- **Find key definitions quickly** — all key terms are **bolded** when first defined throughout the text.
- **Read in any order** — each section is self-contained and can be read independently.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of the Site

- **Watch before you read.** The video gives you a high-level map of the topic; the written content beneath fills in the detail.
- **Take your own notes.** The site doesn't include quizzes or exercises, so keeping notes as you go is the best way to reinforce what you learn.
- **Use in-page search.** Press `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on Mac) to quickly locate any term. All key terms are bolded and defined throughout the text.
- **Don't skip Section 1 if you're new.** It introduces core concepts — like how banks work and what risk management means — that underpin every other section.
- **Revisit sections as needed.** There's no time limit or progress tracking, so you can return to any section at any time.
