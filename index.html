            <h3>Introduction to Financial Markets</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Gain a comprehensive
              understanding of the finance industry and the various business
              lines that operate within banks, along with the financial products
              they offer.
            </p>

            <h4>The Four Main Types of Banks</h4>

            <p>The banking industry consists of four primary categories:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Central Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Manage the money supply in a single country
                or series of nations. Set monetary policy goals.<br />
                <em>Examples:</em> US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retail Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Offer public financial products and services
                such as bank accounts and loans to individual consumers.<br />
                <em>Services:</em> Current accounts, savings accounts,
                mortgages, debit cards, personal loans, online banking
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Universal Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Provide comprehensive financial services
                tailored to retail, commercial, and investment services.<br />
                <em>Examples:</em> Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, HSBC
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Investment Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Act as financial intermediaries performing a
                variety of services, specializing in large and complex financial
                transactions as well as acting as brokers or financial advisors
                for institutional clients.<br />
                <em>Examples:</em> Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Bank Basics: The Fractional Reserve System</h4>

            <p>
              Banking traditionally involves taking surplus cash from lenders
              and acting as a financial intermediator to borrowers. The key
              principle underlying modern banking is the
              <strong>Fractional Reserve System</strong>: banks assume that
              depositors will only want access to a fraction of their deposits
              at any given time. The remaining funds are invested in money
              markets.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Deposit:</strong> A sum of money left with a bank (e.g.,
                the bank pays the depositor 3% interest)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loan:</strong> A sum of money lent from a bank (e.g.,
                the bank charges a borrower 6% interest)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bank's Profit:</strong> The difference between lending
                rate and borrowing rate (in this example, 3%) is typically
                invested in money markets
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Important consideration:</strong> The fractional reserve
              system assumes that not all depositors will withdraw their funds
              simultaneously. If this assumption is violated, the bank's
              reserves may be insufficient to cover all withdrawal requests,
              potentially leading to a bank run.
            </p>

            <h4>Interest Rates and the Interest Rate Spread</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Interest is the percentage of
              principal charged by the lender for the use of its money.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> If you borrow $1,000 at 6% annual
              interest for one year, you must pay back $1,060 after one year.
            </p>

            <p>
              The relationship between depositors and borrowers creates the
              interest rate spread:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Depositors receive interest for money saved with banks</li>
              <li>Banks use this money to lend to borrowers</li>
              <li>Borrowers pay interest for money lent from banks</li>
              <li>
                Banks use loan interest to pay interest to depositors and
                maintain profitability
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Evolution of Modern Banking</h4>

            <p>
              Modern banking has evolved significantly from the traditional
              banking model, introducing key concepts:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Money Market Funding:</strong> Banks now fund operations
                through money markets, not just deposits
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Securitization:</strong> Creation of derivative products
                from banks' own assets or others' assets (loans and mortgages),
                allowing banks to transfer risk
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Originate-to-Distribute Model (O2D):</strong> A
                departure from the traditional "Originate-to-Hold" (OTH) model
                where banks underwrite and hold risk. O2D allows banks to
                originate loans and immediately sell them, removing underwriting
                risk and enabling unlimited distribution of products
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Historical Context:</strong> After the Great Depression in
              the 1930s, the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) required banks to choose
              between commercial banking (accepting deposits) or investment
              banking (market activities). This separation was repealed in 1999,
              allowing the creation of modern universal banks.

OPTION 2: CENTRAL BANKING AND MONETARY POLICY
(For Section 2 - Focus on central banks, interest rates, and inflation)
============================================================ -->

            <h3>Central Banking and Monetary Policy</h3>

            <p>
              Central banks play a crucial role in managing a nation's economy
              through monetary policy. Understanding their functions and tools
              is essential to financial literacy.
            </p>

            <h4>Primary Functions of Central Banks</h4>

            <p>
              Central banks serve as "banks for the banks" and the government.
              Their key responsibilities include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Holding fractional reserves for commercial banks</li>
              <li>
                Providing banking services for the state and other central banks
              </li>
              <li>Supervising other banks and the financial system</li>
              <li>Acting as "lender of last resort" during financial crises</li>
              <li>
                Managing the money supply and implementing monetary policy
              </li>
              <li>Setting interest rates to influence economic activity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Major Central Banks:</strong> Bank of England, Federal
              Reserve System (US), Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Hong
              Kong Monetary Authority
            </p>

            <h4>Interest Rates, Inflation, and Monetary Policy</h4>

            <p><strong>Key Definitions:</strong></p>

            <p>
              <strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The percentage of principal
              charged by the lender for the use of its money.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Inflation:</strong> A quantitative measure of the rate at
              which the average price level of selected goods and services in an
              economy increases over time. It indicates a decrease in the
              purchasing power of a nation's currency. Measured by CPI (Consumer
              Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index).
            </p>

            <h4>The Central Bank's Interest Rate Tool</h4>

            <p>
              Central banks influence inflation by adjusting interest rates
              (they typically have a target inflation rate of around 2%):
            </p>

            <p><strong>Raising Interest Rates:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Encourages saving (higher returns on savings accounts and bonds)
              </li>
              <li>Decreases inflation (reduces spending and demand)</li>
              <li>
                Increases currency demand (higher interest rates attract foreign
                investment)
              </li>
              <li>Leads to higher exchange rates</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Lowering Interest Rates:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Encourages spending and borrowing</li>
              <li>Increases inflation</li>
              <li>Decreases currency demand</li>
              <li>Lowers exchange rates</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Relationship Between Exchange Rates and Inflation</h4>

            <p>
              A higher interest rate should lead to a higher exchange rate,
              which helps reduce inflationary pressure by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Making imports cheaper (lower prices of imported goods)</li>
              <li>Reducing demand for exports</li>
              <li>Increasing incentive for exporters to cut costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Quantitative Easing (QE)</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is Quantitative Easing?</strong> When interest rates
              are very low and inflation needs boosting through spending,
              central banks may employ Quantitative Easing—the creation of new
              money electronically to purchase government bonds or other assets.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The central bank creates new money electronically</li>
              <li>
                This money is used to purchase government bonds or other assets
              </li>
              <li>
                Increased bond prices reduce yields, making bonds less
                attractive
              </li>
              <li>
                Investors seek returns elsewhere, freed-up money flows into
                lending
              </li>
              <li>Increased lending supply lowers the cost of borrowing</li>
              <li>Result: stimulated spending and economic growth</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Reversing QE:</strong> If inflation becomes too high, the
              central bank can sell previously purchased assets to reduce the
              amount of money and spending in the economy, bringing inflation
              back to target levels.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Historical Example:</strong> Quantitative Easing was first
              used in the UK in 2009. The objective is to meet the government's
              inflation target while maintaining economic stability.

              <strong>Definition:</strong> Banking for individual consumers
              offering traditional banking products and services.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Monetary Policy in Retail Banking</h4>

            <p>
              Retail banks can set their own lending and borrowing rates for
              individual clients. However, the rate at which banks lend to each
              other (the interbank rate) is typically influenced by central bank
              policy.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate):</strong> The
              benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one
              another in the international interbank market for short-term
              loans. LIBOR is calculated and published daily by the
              Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example of Rate Setting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Barclays borrows at 1.33% (set by Barclays' lending partner)
              </li>
              <li>Barclays lends to HSBC at 0.93% (set by Barclays)</li>
              <li>Barclays borrows from HSBC at 0.91% (set by HSBC)</li>
              <li>LIBOR average: 0.92% (published benchmark)</li>
              <li>
                Barclays lends to retail customers at 5.5% (set by Barclays)

OPTION 4: CAPITAL MARKETS AND INVESTMENT BANKING
(For Section 4 - Primary and secondary markets, trading operations)
============================================================ -->

            <h3>Capital Markets and Investment Banking Operations</h3>

            <p>
              Capital markets are the backbone of modern finance, enabling the
              flow of capital from savers to borrowers and investors.
            </p>

            <h4>What Are Capital Markets?</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> The system of markets where
              securities (stocks and bonds) are issued and traded, allowing
              companies and governments to raise medium- and long-term
              financing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Investment banks facilitate the operation of capital markets
              alongside exchanges, brokers, interdealer brokers, and market data
              providers. Trading has evolved from traditional open-outcry
              systems to electronic trading platforms.
            </p>

            <h4>Primary vs. Secondary Markets</h4>

            <p><strong>Primary Market: New Security Issuance</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The market where new securities are issued for the first time
              </li>
              <li>
                Allows companies and governments to raise capital directly
              </li>
              <li>
                Includes IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), new bond issuances,
                and new share offerings
              </li>
              <li>
                Raises medium- and long-term financing for capital projects
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>

                Securities</strong
              >
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The market where previously issued securities are bought and
                sold among investors
              </li>
              <li>Provides liquidity, allowing investors to exit positions</li>
              <li>Price discovery through continuous trading activity</li>
              <li>Dominated by electronic trading systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Secondary Market Services: Market Making and Brokerage</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Market Making - Dealers:</strong> Market makers provide
              liquidity by constantly buying and selling securities, profiting
              from the spread between bid and ask prices. They maintain
              inventory and absorb temporary supply/demand imbalances.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Brokerage - Brokers:</strong> Brokers facilitate
              transactions between buyers and sellers, earning commissions
              without taking principal risk. They act as intermediaries matching
              orders.
            </p>

            <h4>M&A and Financing Services</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Mergers and Acquisitions:</strong> Investment banks play a

              <li>Financing and underwriting support</li>
            </ul>

              <li>Investor introductions and management</li>
              <li>
                Syndicated loans (spreading loan participation among multiple

              </li>
              <li>

              Investment Banking Organization: Front Office, Middle Office, and
              Back Office
            </h4>

            <p>
              Investment banks are typically organized into three main
              functional areas:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Front Office:</strong> Client-facing revenue-generating
              activities including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Proprietary Trading: Trading the firm's own capital (nostro
                accounts) to generate profits
              </li>
              <li>

              functions

            <p>
              <strong>Note on Separation:</strong> Strict "Chinese walls"
              (information barriers) exist between research, brokerage, and
              proprietary trading to prevent conflicts of interest and insider
              trading.
            </p>

            <h4>The 24-Hour Banking Day: Follow the Sun</h4>

            <p>
              Global financial markets operate continuously across time zones:
            </p>

            </ul>

            <p>
              Many global banks operate on a "Follow the Sun" support model,
              maintaining operations across multiple time zones to serve clients
              in Asia, Europe, and North America throughout the 24-hour trading
              cycle. Some business areas operate 24/7 (such as online banking),
              introducing continuous system availability requirements.
            </p>

            <p>

OPTION 5: RISK MANAGEMENT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
(For Section 5 - Market risk, diversification, trade lifecycle)
============================================================ -->

            <h3>Risk Management and Market Operations</h3>

            <p>
              Understanding risk is fundamental to investment banking and
              financial decision-making.
            </p>

            <h4>Diversification: A Core Risk Management Strategy</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Diversification is a risk management
              strategy that involves mixing different types of investments
              within a portfolio to limit exposure to any single asset or risk
              factor.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Principle:</strong> All investments involve some level
              of risk. Diversification reduces overall portfolio risk without
              necessarily reducing expected returns.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Risk Appetite:</strong> Both individual investors and
              financial institutions have specific risk appetites—the level of
              risk they are willing to tolerate to achieve their financial
              objectives. Understanding and managing risk appetite is critical
              to sound investment decisions.
            </p>

            <h4>Market Risk: The Four Standard Market Risk Factors</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is Market Risk?</strong> Market risk is the risk that
              movements in market prices lead to losses. It arises from four
              primary sources:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Price Risk:</strong> Prices rise and fall due to market
                sentiment and macroeconomic factors. Securities held in
                inventory may decline in value.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interest Rate Risk:</strong> Changes in interest rates
                affect bond prices and discount rates used in valuation models.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Currency/Foreign Exchange Risk:</strong> Exchange rates
                fluctuate, affecting the value of foreign currency holdings and
                international transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Commodity Price Risk:</strong> Commodity prices (oil,
                metals, agricultural products) fluctuate based on supply and
                demand dynamics.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Hedging Against Market Risk</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Hedging is the use of derivative
              instruments or offsetting positions to mitigate against adverse
              price movements and market risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Measurement of Market Risk:</strong> Market risk is
              measured using various quantitative techniques, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Value-at-Risk (VaR):</strong> A statistical measure
                estimating the maximum potential loss under normal market
                conditions over a specific time period at a given confidence
                level
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stress Testing:</strong> Simulating extreme market
                scenarios to assess portfolio resilience
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> Evaluating portfolio
                performance under various hypothetical market conditions
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Investment Banking Trade Life Cycle</h4>

            <p>
              A typical trade undergoes several stages from conception through
              settlement:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Initiation:</strong> Front office identifies a trading
                opportunity or receives a client request
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deal Structure:</strong> Terms and structure are
                determined
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Execution:</strong> Trade is executed in the market
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Netting:</strong> Offsetting positions across multiple
                transactions are netted (e.g., bought 100 shares of Apple and
                sold 50 in two different transactions = net long 50 shares)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Confirmation:</strong> Middle office confirms trade
                details with counterparties
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Settlement:</strong> Back office settles payment and
                delivery
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Ongoing monitoring of market
                risk and collateral positions
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Types of Asset Classes</h4>

            <p>
              Investment banks deal in multiple asset classes, each with
