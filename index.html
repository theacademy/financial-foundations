            <h3>Introduction to Financial Markets</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Gain a comprehensive
              understanding of the finance industry and the various business
              lines that operate within banks, along with the financial products
              they offer.
            </p>

            <h4>The Four Main Types of Banks</h4>

            <p>The banking industry consists of four primary categories:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Central Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Manage the money supply in a single country
                or series of nations. Set monetary policy goals.<br />
                <em>Examples:</em> US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retail Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Offer public financial products and services
                such as bank accounts and loans to individual consumers.<br />
                <em>Services:</em> Current accounts, savings accounts,
                mortgages, debit cards, personal loans, online banking
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Universal Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Provide comprehensive financial services
                tailored to retail, commercial, and investment services.<br />
                <em>Examples:</em> Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, HSBC
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Investment Banks</strong><br />
                <em>Function:</em> Act as financial intermediaries performing a
                variety of services, specializing in large and complex financial
                transactions as well as acting as brokers or financial advisors
                for institutional clients.<br />
                <em>Examples:</em> Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Bank Basics: The Fractional Reserve System</h4>

            <p>
              Banking traditionally involves taking surplus cash from lenders
              and acting as a financial intermediator to borrowers. The key
              principle underlying modern banking is the
              <strong>Fractional Reserve System</strong>: banks assume that
              depositors will only want access to a fraction of their deposits
              at any given time. The remaining funds are invested in money
              markets.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Deposit:</strong> A sum of money left with a bank (e.g.,
                the bank pays the depositor 3% interest)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loan:</strong> A sum of money lent from a bank (e.g.,
                the bank charges a borrower 6% interest)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bank's Profit:</strong> The difference between lending
                rate and borrowing rate (in this example, 3%) is typically
                invested in money markets
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Important consideration:</strong> The fractional reserve
              system assumes that not all depositors will withdraw their funds
              simultaneously. If this assumption is violated, the bank's
              reserves may be insufficient to cover all withdrawal requests,
              potentially leading to a bank run.
            </p>

            <h4>Interest Rates and the Interest Rate Spread</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Interest is the percentage of
              principal charged by the lender for the use of its money.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> If you borrow $1,000 at 6% annual
              interest for one year, you must pay back $1,060 after one year.
            </p>

            <p>
              The relationship between depositors and borrowers creates the
              interest rate spread:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Depositors receive interest for money saved with banks</li>
              <li>Banks use this money to lend to borrowers</li>
              <li>Borrowers pay interest for money lent from banks</li>
              <li>
                Banks use loan interest to pay interest to depositors and
                maintain profitability
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Evolution of Modern Banking</h4>

            <p>
              Modern banking has evolved significantly from the traditional
              banking model, introducing key concepts:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Money Market Funding:</strong> Banks now fund operations
                through money markets, not just deposits
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Securitization:</strong> Creation of derivative products
                from banks' own assets or others' assets (loans and mortgages),
                allowing banks to transfer risk
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Originate-to-Distribute Model (O2D):</strong> A
                departure from the traditional "Originate-to-Hold" (OTH) model
                where banks underwrite and hold risk. O2D allows banks to
                originate loans and immediately sell them, removing underwriting
                risk and enabling unlimited distribution of products
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Historical Context:</strong> After the Great Depression in
              the 1930s, the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) required banks to choose
              between commercial banking (accepting deposits) or investment
              banking (market activities). This separation was repealed in 1999,
              allowing the creation of modern universal banks.

OPTION 2: CENTRAL BANKING AND MONETARY POLICY
(For Section 2 - Focus on central banks, interest rates, and inflation)
============================================================ -->

            <h3>Central Banking and Monetary Policy</h3>

            <p>
              Central banks play a crucial role in managing a nation's economy
              through monetary policy. Understanding their functions and tools
              is essential to financial literacy.
            </p>

            <h4>Primary Functions of Central Banks</h4>

            <p>
              Central banks serve as "banks for the banks" and the government.
              Their key responsibilities include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Holding fractional reserves for commercial banks</li>
              <li>
                Providing banking services for the state and other central banks
              </li>
              <li>Supervising other banks and the financial system</li>
              <li>Acting as "lender of last resort" during financial crises</li>
              <li>
                Managing the money supply and implementing monetary policy
              </li>
              <li>Setting interest rates to influence economic activity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Major Central Banks:</strong> Bank of England, Federal
              Reserve System (US), Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Hong
              Kong Monetary Authority
            </p>

            <h4>Interest Rates, Inflation, and Monetary Policy</h4>

            <p><strong>Key Definitions:</strong></p>

            <p>
              <strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The percentage of principal
              charged by the lender for the use of its money.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Inflation:</strong> A quantitative measure of the rate at
              which the average price level of selected goods and services in an
              economy increases over time. It indicates a decrease in the
              purchasing power of a nation's currency. Measured by CPI (Consumer
              Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index).
            </p>

            <h4>The Central Bank's Interest Rate Tool</h4>

            <p>
              Central banks influence inflation by adjusting interest rates
              (they typically have a target inflation rate of around 2%):
            </p>

            <p><strong>Raising Interest Rates:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Encourages saving (higher returns on savings accounts and bonds)
              </li>
              <li>Decreases inflation (reduces spending and demand)</li>
              <li>
                Increases currency demand (higher interest rates attract foreign
                investment)
              </li>
              <li>Leads to higher exchange rates</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Lowering Interest Rates:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Encourages spending and borrowing</li>
              <li>Increases inflation</li>
              <li>Decreases currency demand</li>
              <li>Lowers exchange rates</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Relationship Between Exchange Rates and Inflation</h4>

            <p>
              A higher interest rate should lead to a higher exchange rate,
              which helps reduce inflationary pressure by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Making imports cheaper (lower prices of imported goods)</li>
              <li>Reducing demand for exports</li>
              <li>Increasing incentive for exporters to cut costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Quantitative Easing (QE)</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is Quantitative Easing?</strong> When interest rates
              are very low and inflation needs boosting through spending,
              central banks may employ Quantitative Easing—the creation of new
              money electronically to purchase government bonds or other assets.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The central bank creates new money electronically</li>
              <li>
                This money is used to purchase government bonds or other assets
              </li>
              <li>
                Increased bond prices reduce yields, making bonds less
                attractive
              </li>
              <li>
                Investors seek returns elsewhere, freed-up money flows into
                lending
              </li>
              <li>Increased lending supply lowers the cost of borrowing</li>
              <li>Result: stimulated spending and economic growth</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Reversing QE:</strong> If inflation becomes too high, the
              central bank can sell previously purchased assets to reduce the
              amount of money and spending in the economy, bringing inflation
              back to target levels.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Historical Example:</strong> Quantitative Easing was first
              used in the UK in 2009. The objective is to meet the government's
              inflation target while maintaining economic stability.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Banking for individual consumers
              offering traditional banking products and services.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Products and Services:</strong></p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Monetary Policy in Retail Banking</h4>

            <p>
              Retail banks can set their own lending and borrowing rates for
              individual clients. However, the rate at which banks lend to each
              other (the interbank rate) is typically influenced by central bank
              policy.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate):</strong> The
              benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one
              another in the international interbank market for short-term
              loans. LIBOR is calculated and published daily by the
              Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example of Rate Setting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Barclays borrows at 1.33% (set by Barclays' lending partner)
              </li>
              <li>Barclays lends to HSBC at 0.93% (set by Barclays)</li>
              <li>Barclays borrows from HSBC at 0.91% (set by HSBC)</li>
              <li>LIBOR average: 0.92% (published benchmark)</li>
              <li>
                Barclays lends to retail customers at 5.5% (set by Barclays)

OPTION 4: CAPITAL MARKETS AND INVESTMENT BANKING
(For Section 4 - Primary and secondary markets, trading operations)
============================================================ -->

            <h3>Capital Markets and Investment Banking Operations</h3>

            <p>
              Capital markets are the backbone of modern finance, enabling the
              flow of capital from savers to borrowers and investors.
            </p>

            <h4>What Are Capital Markets?</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> The system of markets where
              securities (stocks and bonds) are issued and traded, allowing
              companies and governments to raise medium- and long-term
              financing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Investment banks facilitate the operation of capital markets
              alongside exchanges, brokers, interdealer brokers, and market data
              providers. Trading has evolved from traditional open-outcry
              systems to electronic trading platforms.
            </p>

            <h4>Primary vs. Secondary Markets</h4>

            <p><strong>Primary Market: New Security Issuance</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The market where new securities are issued for the first time
              </li>
              <li>
                Allows companies and governments to raise capital directly
              </li>
              <li>
                Includes IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), new bond issuances,
                and new share offerings
              </li>
              <li>
                Raises medium- and long-term financing for capital projects
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong
                >Secondary Market: Buying and Selling of Existing
                Securities</strong
              >
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The market where previously issued securities are bought and
                sold among investors
              </li>
              <li>Provides liquidity, allowing investors to exit positions</li>
              <li>Price discovery through continuous trading activity</li>
              <li>Dominated by electronic trading systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Secondary Market Services: Market Making and Brokerage</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Market Making - Dealers:</strong> Market makers provide
              liquidity by constantly buying and selling securities, profiting
              from the spread between bid and ask prices. They maintain
              inventory and absorb temporary supply/demand imbalances.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Brokerage - Brokers:</strong> Brokers facilitate
              transactions between buyers and sellers, earning commissions
              without taking principal risk. They act as intermediaries matching
              orders.
            </p>

            <h4>M&A and Financing Services</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Mergers and Acquisitions:</strong> Investment banks play a
              central role in facilitating mergers and acquisitions by
              providing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strategic advisory and valuation expertise</li>

              <li>Financing and underwriting support</li>
            </ul>

            <p>

              capital, investment banks offer:

              <li>Strategic advisory on optimal financing structure</li>
              <li>Investor introductions and management</li>
              <li>
                Syndicated loans (spreading loan participation among multiple

              </li>
              <li>
                Bond and securities issuance (IPOs, corporate bonds, structured

              <li>
                Project financing for major infrastructure and corporate

              Investment Banking Organization: Front Office, Middle Office, and
              Back Office
            </h4>

            <p>
              Investment banks are typically organized into three main
              functional areas:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Front Office:</strong> Client-facing revenue-generating
              activities including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Proprietary Trading: Trading the firm's own capital (nostro
                accounts) to generate profits
              </li>
              <li>
                Sales and Trading: Selling securities to clients and making

              functions

            <p>
              <strong>Note on Separation:</strong> Strict "Chinese walls"
              (information barriers) exist between research, brokerage, and
              proprietary trading to prevent conflicts of interest and insider
              trading.
            </p>

            <h4>The 24-Hour Banking Day: Follow the Sun</h4>

            <p>
              Global financial markets operate continuously across time zones:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tokyo Market Open:</strong> 00:00 GMT / 09:00 JST</li>
              <li>

            </ul>

            <p>
              Many global banks operate on a "Follow the Sun" support model,
              maintaining operations across multiple time zones to serve clients
              in Asia, Europe, and North America throughout the 24-hour trading
              cycle. Some business areas operate 24/7 (such as online banking),
              introducing continuous system availability requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Daylight savings time adjustments affect
              these opening times seasonally.

OPTION 5: RISK MANAGEMENT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
(For Section 5 - Market risk, diversification, trade lifecycle)
============================================================ -->

            <h3>Risk Management and Market Operations</h3>

            <p>
              Understanding risk is fundamental to investment banking and
              financial decision-making.
            </p>

            <h4>Diversification: A Core Risk Management Strategy</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Diversification is a risk management
              strategy that involves mixing different types of investments
              within a portfolio to limit exposure to any single asset or risk
              factor.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Principle:</strong> All investments involve some level
              of risk. Diversification reduces overall portfolio risk without
              necessarily reducing expected returns.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Risk Appetite:</strong> Both individual investors and
              financial institutions have specific risk appetites—the level of
              risk they are willing to tolerate to achieve their financial
              objectives. Understanding and managing risk appetite is critical
              to sound investment decisions.
            </p>

            <h4>Market Risk: The Four Standard Market Risk Factors</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is Market Risk?</strong> Market risk is the risk that
              movements in market prices lead to losses. It arises from four
              primary sources:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Price Risk:</strong> Prices rise and fall due to market
                sentiment and macroeconomic factors. Securities held in
                inventory may decline in value.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interest Rate Risk:</strong> Changes in interest rates
                affect bond prices and discount rates used in valuation models.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Currency/Foreign Exchange Risk:</strong> Exchange rates
                fluctuate, affecting the value of foreign currency holdings and
                international transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Commodity Price Risk:</strong> Commodity prices (oil,
                metals, agricultural products) fluctuate based on supply and
                demand dynamics.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Hedging Against Market Risk</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Hedging is the use of derivative
              instruments or offsetting positions to mitigate against adverse
              price movements and market risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Measurement of Market Risk:</strong> Market risk is
              measured using various quantitative techniques, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Value-at-Risk (VaR):</strong> A statistical measure
                estimating the maximum potential loss under normal market
                conditions over a specific time period at a given confidence
                level
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stress Testing:</strong> Simulating extreme market
                scenarios to assess portfolio resilience
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> Evaluating portfolio
                performance under various hypothetical market conditions
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Investment Banking Trade Life Cycle</h4>

            <p>
              A typical trade undergoes several stages from conception through
              settlement:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Initiation:</strong> Front office identifies a trading
                opportunity or receives a client request
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deal Structure:</strong> Terms and structure are
                determined
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Execution:</strong> Trade is executed in the market
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Netting:</strong> Offsetting positions across multiple
                transactions are netted (e.g., bought 100 shares of Apple and
                sold 50 in two different transactions = net long 50 shares)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Confirmation:</strong> Middle office confirms trade
                details with counterparties
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Settlement:</strong> Back office settles payment and
                delivery
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Ongoing monitoring of market
                risk and collateral positions
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Types of Asset Classes</h4>

            <p>
              Investment banks deal in multiple asset classes, each with
              distinct characteristics:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Equities:</strong> Ownership stakes in companies (stocks
                and share derivatives)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fixed Income/Bonds:</strong> Debt securities issued by
                corporations and governments
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Foreign Exchange (FX):</strong> Trading in currencies
                and exchange rates
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Commodities:</strong> Physical goods such as metals,
                energy products, and agricultural products
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Derivatives:</strong> Financial contracts whose value is
                derived from underlying assets (options, futures, swaps,
                forwards)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Structured Products:</strong> Complex securities
                combining multiple underlying assets and derivatives
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Risk Considerations:</strong> Each asset class has
              different risk-return characteristics. Understanding these
              differences is essential for portfolio construction and risk
              management.

OPTION 1: EQUITY TRADING FUNDAMENTALS
(For Section 1 - Introduction, IPOs, and market basics)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Equity Trading Fundamentals</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Understand the equity trading
              business, including the process of companies going public, share
              types, and the fundamentals of stock markets.
            </p>

            <h4>What is Equity Trading?</h4>

            <p>
              Equity trading involves buying and selling shares of publicly
              traded companies on stock exchanges. When a company decides to go
              public through an Initial Public Offering (IPO), its shares become
              available for trading in the open market. This allows investors to
              own a piece of the company, and gives the company access to
              capital from public investors.
            </p>

            <h4>The Journey from Private to Public Company</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Private Company:</strong> A company operates privately
              with its equity divided among founders, employees, and investors.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>IPO (Initial Public Offering):</strong> The first sale of
              shares to the public, where the company lists on a stock exchange.
              This brings new rules and regulations but also access to public
              capital markets.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Public Company:</strong> The company's shares are now
              traded publicly, and equity is divided among new shareholders
              alongside original shareholders.
            </p>

            <h4>Market Capitalization (Market Cap)</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> A company's total market value,
              calculated as the stock price multiplied by the number of shares
              outstanding.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Key Terms:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Outstanding Shares:</strong> Shares issued by a public
                company that are freely available to be bought by anyone
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Restricted Stock:</strong> Shares that can only be
                traded under SEC regulations
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Floating Stock:</strong> Shares currently available to
                trade
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Companies are ranked by market cap into categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Large Cap:</strong> Largest companies, often referred to
                as "blue chip companies"
              </li>
              <li><strong>Mid Cap:</strong> Medium-sized companies</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Small Cap:</strong> Smaller companies with greater
                growth potential
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Dividends</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> A distribution of a portion of a
              company's earnings, decided by the board of directors. Dividends
              can be paid in cash or stock, and are typically paid twice a year.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Why Investors Care About Dividends:</strong> Investors
              invest in equities for two main reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Capital appreciation (share price growth)</li>
              <li>Dividend income (regular cash payments)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Why Companies Pay Dividends:</strong> A company with
              excess cash might choose to distribute it as dividends rather than
              face acquisition. For example, if a company has $10,000 in the
              bank but a market cap of only $2,000, it could theoretically be
              bought and liquidated for profit. Instead, distributing the excess
              cash as dividends is more attractive to shareholders.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> Apple issued a $0.77 dividend on
              February 13, 2020. An investor who owned 500 shares would have
              received $385.
            </p>

            <h4>Share Classes</h4>

            <p>
              Different companies may issue multiple classes of shares with
              different rights and privileges:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Ordinary Shares (Common Stock):</strong> Standard shares
                with dividend and voting rights. Dividend paid after preference
                shares
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Preference Shares:</strong> Receive dividends ahead of
                ordinary shares. Entitled to fixed dividend amounts. Often carry
                no voting rights
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Deferred Ordinary Shares:</strong> Dividend payment
                deferred until after other share classes receive minimum
                dividends
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Non-Voting Ordinary Shares:</strong> No voting rights,
                or voting rights restricted to certain circumstances
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Redeemable Shares:</strong> Company has the option to
                buy back the shares at a predetermined price
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Case Study: Google Share Classes</h4>

            <p>Google demonstrates a multi-class share structure:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Class A Shares (GOOGL):</strong> Held by regular
                investors. One vote per share
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Class C Shares (GOOG):</strong> Held by employees and
                Class A stockholders. No voting rights
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Founder Shares (No Symbol):</strong> Held by the
                founders. 10 times the voting power of Class A shares
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This structure allows founders to maintain significant control
              despite public ownership.
            </p>

            <h4>Case Study: Snapchat IPO</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>March 1, 2017 (Day Before IPO):</strong> Stock priced at
              $17 per share. Valuation: $24 billion. Notably, shares carried no
              voting rights.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>March 2, 2017 (Day of IPO):</strong> Price soars to
              $26.05. Stock closes at $24.48—up 44%. Snap valued at $34.56
              billion.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>March 3, 2017 (Day After IPO):</strong> Media commentary:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Financial Times: "Snap IPO is the foolish leading the blind"
              </li>
              <li>
                Fortune: "Here's how Snap's IPO just proved we're in a tech
                bubble"
              </li>
              <li>
                CityAM: "Hold off on criticizing…it may be a Facebook, rather
                than a Twitter"
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The Snapchat IPO illustrates the excitement and skepticism that
              can surround IPOs, especially in the technology sector.
            </p>

OPTION 2: STOCK EXCHANGES AND MARKET MECHANICS
(For Section 2 - Exchanges, orderbooks, and trading types)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Stock Exchanges and Market Mechanics</h3>

            <p>
              Understanding how stock exchanges work and the mechanics of
              trading is essential to equity trading.
            </p>

            <h4>What Are Stock Exchanges?</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Electronic marketplaces for trading
              shares and other securities.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stocks are listed on one domestic exchange (though can be listed
                on other venues)
              </li>
              <li>
                Companies pay listing fees plus annual fees to maintain their
                listing
              </li>
              <li>
                Exchanges provide regulated, transparent trading environments
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Major Stock Exchanges:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>NYSE (New York Stock Exchange):</strong> A physical
                exchange using an auction market model
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Nasdaq:</strong> Totally electronic. Handles greater
                daily traded share volume than NYSE
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>A Day in the Life of Trading</h4>

            <p>
              Traditional markets like NYSE operate through distinct phases:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Opening Auction (7:30am EST):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Orders can be entered as early as 7:30am (MOO - Market on Open,
                or LOO - Limit on Open)
              </li>
              <li>Reference price is the previous day's closing price</li>
              <li>Auction opens at 9:30am EST</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Continuous Trading (9:30am - 3:58pm EST):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Orders are placed onto the orderbook throughout the day</li>
              <li>Orders are matched based on price and priority</li>
              <li>Provides continuous price discovery</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Closing Auction (3:58pm - 4:00pm EST):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                MOC (Market on Close) and LOC (Limit on Close) orders can be
                entered
              </li>
              <li>At 3:58pm, orders can no longer be cancelled</li>
              <li>Market closes at 4:00pm EST</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Understanding the Orderbook</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is an Orderbook?</strong> A real-time display of all
              active buy and sell orders for a security on an exchange.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Bid:</strong> The maximum price a buyer is willing to
                pay for the stock
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ask:</strong> The minimum price a seller is willing to
                accept
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Spread:</strong> The difference between the highest bid
                and lowest ask (bid-ask spread)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>MPID:</strong> Market Participant ID—identifies who
                placed the order
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>BBO/NBBO:</strong> Best Bid and Offer (Best on one
                exchange) vs. National Best Bid and Offer (best across all
                venues)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> If the best bid is $93.03 and the best
              ask is $93.04, the spread is $0.01. This means buyers and sellers
              are very close on price.
            </p>

            <h4>Order Types</h4>

            <p>Traders use various order types to execute trades:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Market Order:</strong> Execute immediately at the best
                available price, regardless of price level
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Limit Order:</strong> Execute only at a specified price
                or better. Provides price protection but may not execute
              </li>

              <li><strong>On Open:</strong> Execute in the opening auction</li>

              <li><strong>On Close:</strong> Execute in the closing auction</li>

              <li>
                <strong>Hidden (Iceberg) Order:</strong> Limit order where price
                and volume are not displayed to other market participants. Only
                a small portion is visible
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>IOC (Immediate or Cancel):</strong> Execute immediately
                any portion that can be filled, cancel the rest
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>FOK (Fill or Kill):</strong> Execute the entire order
                immediately or cancel it entirely. No partial fills accepted
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Liquidity and the Bid-Ask Spread</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Liquidity:</strong> The ease of converting a security into
              cash without significantly impacting its price.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Bid-Ask Spread Implications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Narrow spreads = high liquidity, easy to buy/sell at fair prices
              </li>
              <li>
                Wide spreads = low liquidity, difficult to trade without price
                impact
              </li>
              <li>
                Large institutional trades may temporarily widen spreads due to
                size
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Long and Short Positions</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Long Position:</strong> Buying shares with the expectation
              they will increase in value
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maximum loss: the amount invested</li>
              <li>Maximum gain: unlimited (theoretically)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Short Position:</strong> Selling borrowed shares with a
              contract to buy them back later at a lower price
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Requires a "locate" agreement with a broker to borrow shares
              </li>
              <li>Maximum loss: unlimited (price could rise indefinitely)</li>
              <li>Riskier than long positions</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Basis Points and Ticks</h4>

            <p><strong>Basis Points (BIPs):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>1 BIP = 1/100 of a percentage point</li>
              <li>Example: 5% is 50 BIPs higher than 4.5%</li>
              <li>100 BIPs = 1%</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Stock Ticks:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The smallest valid price change for a stock</li>
              <li>Example: 1 cent tick (USD), 1 pence tick (GBP)</li>
              <li>Different securities may have different tick sizes</li>
            </ul>

OPTION 3: MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND INDICES
(For Section 3 - Market indexes, indices, and different trading venues)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Market Participants and Market Indices</h3>

            <p>
              Understanding the different participants in equity markets and how
              market indices work is fundamental to equity trading.
            </p>

            <h4>Why Invest in Equities?</h4>

            <p>Investors are drawn to equity markets for several reasons:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Regular Income:</strong> Dividend payments from
                profitable companies
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Capital Growth:</strong> Appreciation in share price
                over time
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Long Term Investment:</strong> Equities are suitable for
                patient capital
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>High Liquidity:</strong> Most public stocks can be
                bought/sold quickly
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transparent Marketplace:</strong> Prices and trading
                information are publicly available
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ownership and Voting Rights:</strong> Shareholders can
                influence company decisions
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Market Indices</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> A hypothetical portfolio of
              investment holdings that represents a segment of the financial
              market.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Aggregates the price of several securities</li>
              <li>Serves as a trend indicator for market sentiment</li>
              <li>Used as performance benchmarks for investors</li>
              <li>
                Help compare portfolio performance against market performance
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>How Indices Work:</strong> An index is calculated from a
              weighted combination of its constituent stocks. Changes in the
              index reflect overall market movement in that segment.
            </p>

            <h4>ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> A collection of securities (stocks,
              bonds, commodities, currencies) bundled into a single financial
              product and traded like a stock.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Instant diversification across many securities</li>
              <li>Lower fees than active mutual funds</li>
              <li>Trade like stocks during market hours</li>
              <li>Transparent holdings and pricing</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example Indices</h4>

            <p><strong>Nasdaq Indices:</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <strong>NDQ:</strong> Top 100 non-financial companies,
                market-cap weighted
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>NDXE:</strong> Top 100 non-financial companies, equally
                weighted
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Regional Indices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>MID (S&P):</strong> 400 mid-cap companies</li>
              <li>
                <strong>OMXS30 (Nasdaq Stockholm):</strong> 30 most traded
                Swedish companies
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Sector Indices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>DRG (Nasdaq):</strong> Pharmaceutical companies larger
                than $75 million market cap
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Certificates issued by US banks
              representing shares in foreign companies, allowing investment in
              non-US companies on US exchanges.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How ADRs Work:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A US bank holds the actual foreign shares</li>
              <li>
                Issues ADR certificates representing one or more foreign shares
              </li>
              <li>ADRs trade on US exchanges like regular stocks</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Avoids currency exchange issues (dividends converted to USD)
              </li>
              <li>No need to establish foreign brokerage accounts</li>
              <li>
                Allows foreign companies to attract US investors without US
                listing
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> A foreign company's shares on the local
              exchange can be held by a US bank and represented as ADRs on the
              NYSE or Nasdaq, allowing US investors to participate.
            </p>

            <h4>The Fundamentals of Trading: Buy Low, Sell High</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Core Principle:</strong> "Buy low and sell high" is one of
              the most fundamental concepts in stock market investing.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Market Cycles:</strong> Stock prices follow consistent
              patterns around the business cycle and market sentiment:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Bull Market:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prices rising or expected to rise</li>
              <li>Optimistic times of economic growth</li>
              <li>Good time to hold or buy quality stocks</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Bear Market:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prices falling or expected to fall</li>
              <li>Times typically shrouded in pessimism</li>
              <li>Maximum fear can be a buying opportunity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Sentiment and Timing:</strong> Times of maximum fear
              (market crashes) are often good times to buy; times of maximum
              greed are times to sell.
            </p>

OPTION 4: ALGORITHMIC TRADING AND ADVANCED VENUES
(For Section 4 - Algo trading, dark pools, and high-frequency trading)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Algorithmic Trading and Advanced Trading Venues</h3>

            <p>
              Modern equity trading relies heavily on technology, algorithms,
              and multiple trading venues to execute orders efficiently.
            </p>

            <h4>Types of Equity Trading</h4>

            <p><strong>Electronic Trading (E-Trading) - Low Touch:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>On Exchange Trading:</strong> Trading on official stock
                exchanges
              </li>
              <li>High speed (low latency) execution</li>
              <li>Transparent pricing (orderbook visible)</li>
              <li>Standardized contracts and rules</li>
              <li>
                Facilitates algorithmic trading, HFT, and direct market access
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Over-the-Counter Trading (OTC) - High Touch:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Agreement to make a trade, often verbally or electronically
                between parties
              </li>
              <li>Off exchange (not on official exchange)</li>
              <li>May take several days to settle</li>
              <li>Flexible terms and conditions</li>
              <li>Facilitates complex, customized deals</li>
              <li>Less transparency than exchange trading</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Smart Order Routing (SOR)</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> Once an algorithm decides to execute an
              order, the SOR determines the optimal exchange or venue to route
              the order for best price.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How SOR Works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Monitors liquidity across multiple exchanges</li>
              <li>Considers dark pools and alternative venues</li>
              <li>Routes order to venue with best price at that moment</li>
              <li>Uses consolidated orderbook feed from market data</li>
              <li>Executes strategies to minimize market impact</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Consideration:</strong> Liquidity varies significantly
              across different exchanges, so routing to the best venue can
              result in significant cost savings.
            </p>

            <h4>Algorithmic Trading Strategies</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Algorithms allow execution of orders
              in a programmatic way around variables such as price, timing, and
              volume.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Common Strategies:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Uses historical data to calculate average market price over a
                time period
              </li>
              <li>
                Splits large orders into smaller pieces to minimize market
                impact
              </li>
              <li>
                Formula: (number of shares bought × share price) / total shares
                bought
              </li>
              <li>Goal: Execute at or better than average price</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Splits order evenly over a specified time period</li>
              <li>
                Example: spread this order equally over the next two hours
              </li>
              <li>Simple but less sophisticated than VWAP</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. POV (Percentage of Volume)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Executes a percentage of market volume until order is complete
              </li>
              <li>Adaptive to changing market conditions</li>
              <li>Helps stay "with the market"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4. IS (Implementation Shortfall)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trades more when price is favorable</li>
              <li>Trades less when price is unfavorable</li>
              <li>Optimizes timing based on price signals</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Requirements:</strong> All algorithmic strategies require
              both historical trading data and live market data to make
              intelligent execution decisions.
            </p>

            <h4>Dark Pools and Crossing Networks</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Private exchanges or forums for
              trading where the orderbook is not visible to the public.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Why Dark Pools Exist:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cost savings: Avoid exchange fees for internal trades</li>
              <li>
                Large orders: Execute big trades without revealing intentions to
                market
              </li>
              <li>
                Protect trading strategies: Hide order flow from competitors
              </li>
              <li>Liquidity: Banks have access to other firms' dark pools</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>How They Work:</strong> If two traders at the same bank
              (one selling Apple, one buying Apple) match internally, they can
              trade without going to the exchange and paying fees. This internal
              crossing network is essentially a dark pool.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Regulatory Note:</strong> Dark pools are regulated
              differently than lit exchanges and have reporting requirements,
              but offer less transparency to other market participants.
            </p>

              <strong>Trading Implications:</strong> Securities may trade on
              multiple exchanges or ATS simultaneously, requiring smart order
              routing to find the best price.

OPTION 5: HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING AND MARKET STRUCTURE
(For Section 5 - HFT, market making, and circuit breakers)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>High-Frequency Trading and Market Making</h3>

            <p>
              Modern equity markets are shaped by high-speed trading
              technologies and market makers who provide liquidity.
            </p>

            <h4>Stock Identifiers</h4>

            <p>
              When securities trade electronically, multiple identifiers are
              used:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Ticker/Instrument Code:</strong> Main identifier (e.g.,
                AAPL). Doesn't indicate where traded
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>RIC (Reuters Identity Code):</strong> Reuters-specific
                code showing primary listing (e.g., AAPL.N for NYSE)
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Bloomberg ID:</strong> Bloomberg's identifier (e.g.,
                AAPL:US)
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>SEDOL:</strong> Stock Exchange Daily Official List.
                Seven characters (e.g., B0YQ5W0)
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>ISIN:</strong> International Securities Identification
                Number. Twelve characters (e.g., US0378331005)
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>CUSIP:</strong> Committee on Uniform Securities
                Identification Procedures. Nine characters (e.g., 037833100)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Why Multiple Identifiers?</strong> Different systems and
              regions use different identification schemes. Mapping between
              identifiers is critical for electronic trading.
            </p>

            <h4>High-Frequency Trading (HFT)</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> An automated trading platform that
              executes large numbers of orders at extremely high speeds.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Uses algorithms and high-speed computers</li>
              <li>Orders usually sent as limit orders</li>
              <li>Orders cancelled immediately if they don't trade</li>
              <li>Focuses on making thousands of small profits that add up</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Low Latency Trading:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Technology constantly optimized to reduce decision-making time
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduces time between market data receipt and order execution
              </li>
              <li>Measured in microseconds and milliseconds</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Co-location (Colos):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some exchanges allow HFT firms to place servers directly next to
                exchange servers
              </li>
              <li>Significantly reduces latency (network delay)</li>
              <li>Available for a high fee</li>
              <li>
                Creates competitive advantage for firms that can afford it
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Benefits:</strong> Increased market liquidity and tighter
              bid-ask spreads
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Criticisms:</strong> May create unfair advantages and
              potential market instability
            </p>

            <h4>Market Making</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> A principal trading activity where
              market makers use their own accounts to continuously quote prices
              and facilitate trading.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Profit on the bid-ask spread (buy
              at bid, sell at ask)
            </p>

            <p><strong>Market Maker Responsibilities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trade principally (use bank's own capital)</li>
              <li>Enter and adjust quotes to buy and sell</li>
              <li>Execute and clear orders on exchanges</li>
              <li>
                Commit to continuously quote prices for a set of securities
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Value to Markets:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provides continuous liquidity</li>
              <li>Reduces bid-ask spreads</li>
              <li>Enables efficient price discovery</li>
              <li>Facilitates trading at fair prices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Risks:</strong> Market makers hold inventory and are
              exposed to adverse price movements. Large price moves can result
              in significant losses.
            </p>

            <h4>Market Crashes and Circuit Breakers</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Understanding Market Crashes:</strong> Stock markets can
              experience dramatic declines due to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Loss of confidence in market fundamentals</li>
              <li>Systemic financial crises</li>
              <li>Rapid changes in sentiment</li>
              <li>Technical or algorithmic failures</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Historical Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Wall Street Crash (1929):</strong> Lasted 12-25 years
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Black Monday (1987):</strong> Lasted 456 trading days
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tech Bubble (2000):</strong> Lasted 1015 trading days
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Global Financial Crisis (2008):</strong> Lasted 230
                trading days
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flash Crash (2010):</strong> Lasted only 36 minutes
                (quickly recovered)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Circuit Breakers:</strong></p>

            <p>
              Implemented after Black Monday in 1987, circuit breakers are
              automatic trading halts designed to curb panic selling.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>For Individual Securities:</strong> Triggered if price
              increases or decreases by a certain percentage. Stock is halted
              from trading for a brief period.
            </p>

            <p><strong>For Market Indices (S&P 500):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Level 1 (7% decline):</strong> Trading halted for 15
                minutes (unless after 3:25pm EST)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Level 2 (13% decline):</strong> Trading halted for 15
                minutes (unless after 3:25pm EST)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Level 3 (20% decline):</strong> Trading halted for
                remainder of day
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> Allow market participants time to
              process information and reduce panic-driven selling. This circuit
              breaker mechanism has likely prevented even more severe market
              crashes.
            </p>

            <h4>Trading System Architecture</h4>

            <p><strong>Typical Components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Order Manager:</strong> Handles incoming orders and
                validation

            <p>
              <strong>Reliability and Scale:</strong> Trading systems handle
              millions of orders daily and require:
            </p>

OPTION 1: FIXED INCOME FUNDAMENTALS AND DEBT PRODUCTS
(For Section - Introduction to bonds, debt, and money markets)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Fixed Income Fundamentals</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Understand the fixed income
              business, including debt products, bonds, and money markets. Learn
              how bonds work and why investors use them.
            </p>

            <h4>What is Fixed Income?</h4>

            <p>
              Fixed income refers to investment securities that pay a fixed rate
              of return. The primary types of fixed income products are bonds
              and money market instruments. These products are essential to
              capital markets and provide investors with regular income streams.
            </p>

            <h4>Debt Products: Understanding the Basics</h4>

            <p><strong>How Traditional Loans Work:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lender loans capital to borrower</li>
              <li>Borrower repays capital plus interest over agreed period</li>
              <li>Simple bilateral relationship between lender and borrower</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How Bonds Work (Alternative to Loans):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Issuer (government or company) raises capital by issuing bonds
              </li>
              <li>
                Investors purchase bonds at par value (issue price × quantity)
              </li>
              <li>
                Issuer repays investors' capital at maturity plus periodic
                coupon payments
              </li>
              <li>
                Allows capital raising from many investors instead of single
                lender
              </li>
              <li>Bonds can be traded, unlike traditional loans</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Advantage:</strong> Bonds allow borrowers to raise
              large amounts of capital from many investors simultaneously, and
              investors can buy and sell bonds in secondary markets.
            </p>

            <h4>Coupons: Regular Interest Payments</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Coupons are the regular interest
              payments made by the bond issuer to bondholders.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Payment Frequency:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Traditionally: Semi-annual coupon payments (twice per year)
              </li>
              <li>Also: Annual payments</li>
              <li>
                Increasingly: Electronic trading eliminates need for physical
                coupons
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> A bond with a 5% coupon rate and $1,000
              par value pays $50 per year (typically $25 every 6 months).
            </p>

            <h4>Short-Term Debt Instruments</h4>

            <p><strong>Commercial Paper (CP):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maturity: Usually 1-6 months</li>
              <li>Issued by: Banks and large corporations</li>
              <li>Type: Unsecured debt (no collateral)</li>
              <li>Advantages: Faster approval than business loans</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>US Treasury Bills (T-Bills):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Issuer: US Government</li>
              <li>Maturities: Up to just less than 1 year</li>
              <li>Denominations: $1,000 minimum</li>
              <li>Pricing: Issued at a discount from par (face value)</li>
              <li>
                Repayment: Paid at par on maturity (buyer keeps the discount as
                interest)
              </li>
              <li>Safety: Backed by US government (lowest risk)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>SEC Registration:</strong> Short-term debt under 270 days
              doesn't require SEC registration, reducing issuance costs.
            </p>

            <h4>Repos: Repurchase Agreements</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is a Repo?</strong> A "repo" (repurchase agreement)
              is a short-term loan where the borrower sells securities with an
              agreement to repurchase them at a higher price the next day.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Typical Use:</strong> Investment banks use repos to meet
              fractional reserve requirements and manage short-term liquidity
              needs.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How a Repo Works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Day T:</strong> Repo seller provides assets to lender
                and receives cash
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Overnight:</strong> Lender holds securities as
                collateral protection
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Day T+1:</strong> Repo seller repurchases assets with
                fee/interest
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> An investment bank needs $1 million to
              meet reserve requirements. They repo (sell with buy-back
              agreement) $1 million in Treasury securities to a lender
              overnight. The next day, they repurchase the Treasuries plus pay a
              small fee.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Reverse Repo:</strong> The opposite transaction where a
              dealer borrows assets and lends money.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Repo Rates:</strong> Usually lower than money market rates
              because the lender is protected by collateral (government
              securities), making the transaction lower risk.
            </p>

            <h4>Why Invest in Bonds?</h4>

            <p>Investors are attracted to fixed income for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Regular Income:</strong> Predictable coupon payments
                provide steady cash flow
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Capital Preservation:</strong> Bonds return principal at
                maturity
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lower Volatility:</strong> Less risky than equities
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Portfolio Diversification:</strong> Different
                risk/return profile than stocks
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Predictable Returns:</strong> Known interest payments
                and maturity date
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Safety (Government Bonds):</strong> Backed by government
                credit
              </li>
            </ul>

OPTION 2: BONDS, INTEREST RATES, AND DURATION
(For Section - Bond mechanics, pricing, interest rate relationships)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Bonds and Interest Rates</h3>

            <p>
              Understanding the relationship between bond prices and interest
              rates is critical to fixed income investing and trading.
            </p>

            <h4>The Inverse Relationship: Bonds and Interest Rates</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Fundamental Principle:</strong> Bond prices and interest
              rates have an inverse relationship—when one goes up, the other
              goes down.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Higher Interest Rates:</strong> New bonds offer higher
                coupon payments, making existing bonds with lower coupons less
                attractive. Their prices fall to compete.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lower Interest Rates:</strong> New bonds offer lower
                coupon payments, making existing bonds with higher coupons more
                attractive. Their prices rise.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Visual Relationship:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Higher interest rates → Lower bond prices</li>
              <li>Lower interest rates → Higher bond prices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Price Convergence to Par:</strong> As a bond approaches
              its maturity date, its price trends toward par value (face value),
              regardless of current interest rates. On the maturity date, the
              bondholder receives exactly par value.
            </p>

            <h4>The Coupon Rate vs. Interest Rate Spread</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Principle:</strong> The bigger the difference between
              a bond's coupon rate and the current interest rate, the bigger the
              price change when rates change.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example 1: Small Spread</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bond coupon rate: 4%</li>
              <li>Current interest rate: 3.8%</li>
              <li>Spread: 0.2% (small difference)</li>
              <li>Price will be only slightly above par</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example 2: Large Spread</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bond coupon rate: 5%</li>
              <li>Current interest rate: 3% (rates have fallen)</li>
              <li>Spread: 2% (large difference)</li>
              <li>Price will be significantly above par</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Duration: Measuring Interest Rate Risk</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Duration is a measure of a bond's
              sensitivity to interest rate changes. It measures how long it
              takes, in years, for an investor to be repaid through the bond's
              total cash flows.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Important Note:</strong> Duration is NOT the same as
              maturity. Duration accounts for all the coupon payments received
              before maturity, while maturity is just the final repayment date.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Duration Calculation:</strong> Duration is expressed in
              years and represents how much the bond price will change for each
              1% change in interest rates.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Duration Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Bond A:</strong> Duration of 5 years</li>
              <li><strong>Interest rate increase of 1%</strong></li>
              <li>
                <strong>Price change:</strong> Approximately -5% (price drops
                5%)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Another Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Bond B:</strong> Duration of 2 years</li>
              <li><strong>Interest rate decrease of 1%</strong></li>
              <li>
                <strong>Price change:</strong> Approximately +2% (price rises
                2%)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Higher duration bonds experience
              bigger price swings when interest rates change. This is critical
              if you plan to sell a bond before maturity—your return depends on
              the selling price, not just the coupon.
            </p>

            <h4>Yield on a Bond</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Yield is the total return an investor
              receives from a bond, measured as the interest on their
              investment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Relationship to Price:</strong> As bond price rises, yield
              falls. As bond price falls, yield rises.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coupon payment remains fixed</li>
              <li>
                When price rises, the fixed coupon represents a smaller return
                on investment
              </li>
              <li>
                When price falls, the fixed coupon represents a larger return on
                investment
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example 1: Price Rise (Safety Premium)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You invest £100 in a 5% bond at par value</li>
              <li>Your yield = 5/100 = 5%</li>
              <li>Bond is considered safe (high quality)</li>
              <li>Bond price rises to £120 (investors want it for safety)</li>
              <li>Your yield now = 5/120 = 4.2% (yield falls)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example 2: Price Fall (Risk Premium)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You invest £100 in a 6% bond at par value</li>
              <li>Your yield = 6/100 = 6%</li>
              <li>Bond is considered risky (company troubles)</li>
              <li>
                Bond price falls to £85 (investors demand compensation for risk)
              </li>
              <li>
                Your yield now = 6/85 = 7% (yield rises to compensate for risk)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Junk Bonds:</strong> Bonds with below-par prices
              (indicating high risk) are known as "high yield" bonds. These
              offer higher yields but carry substantial default risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Formula:</strong> Yield = Annual Coupon Payment / Current
              Bond Price
            </p>

OPTION 3: BOND TYPES, RATINGS, AND EXAMPLES
(For Section - Different bond categories, credit ratings, real-world examples)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Bond Types and Credit Ratings</h3>

            <p>
              The fixed income market includes many different types of bonds
              with varying risk and return characteristics.
            </p>

            <h4>Bond Categories</h4>

            <p>Fixed income products can be categorized in multiple ways:</p>

            <p><strong>By Issuer Type:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Government Bonds:</strong> Issued by national
                governments
              </li>
              <li><strong>Corporate Bonds:</strong> Issued by companies</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Municipal Bonds:</strong> Issued by state and local
                governments
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sovereign Debt:</strong> Government bonds issued
                internationally
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>By Maturity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Short-term:</strong> Less than 1-5 years</li>
              <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> 5-10 years</li>
              <li><strong>Long-term:</strong> 10-50+ years</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>By Interest Type:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Fixed Rate:</strong> Coupon rate stays the same
                throughout bond life
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Floating Rate:</strong> Coupon rate adjusts based on
                market interest rates
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Zero Coupon:</strong> No coupon payments; issued at deep
                discount
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Bond Grades and Credit Ratings</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> Credit ratings indicate the issuer's
              ability to repay the bond and the risk of default.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Rating Categories:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Investment Grade Bonds (Lower Risk):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>AAA:</strong> Highest quality. Government bonds or very
                high-quality corporates. Lowest default risk
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AA:</strong> Very high quality. Strong financial
                position
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A:</strong> High quality. Favorable financial position
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>BBB:</strong> Upper medium grade. Adequate financial
                capacity to meet obligations
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>High Yield / Junk Bonds (Higher Risk):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>BB:</strong> Non-investment grade. Speculative. Some
                uncertainty
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>B:</strong> Speculative. Minimal financial stability
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CCC:</strong> Substantial risks. Poor financial position
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CC:</strong> Extremely speculative. Very high default
                risk
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Key Principle:</strong> Higher credit ratings = lower risk
              = lower yields. Lower credit ratings = higher risk = higher yields
              to compensate.
            </p>

            <h4>Municipal Bonds</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Bonds issued by states, cities,
              counties, and other governmental entities (not the national
              government).
            </p>

            <p><strong>Use of Proceeds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Finance day-to-day government operations</li>
              <li>
                Fund major infrastructure projects (schools, highways, bridges)
              </li>
              <li>Build public facilities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Tax Advantage:</strong> Interest income from municipal
              bonds is typically exempt from federal income tax (and sometimes
              state taxes). This allows municipalities to issue bonds at lower
              rates than corporations.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example Municipal Bond:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Issuer: Huntington Beach California Union High School District
              </li>
              <li>Purpose: 2016 Refunding and School Financing Projects</li>
              <li>Coupon: 2%</li>
              <li>Maturity: September 1, 2027</li>
              <li>Rating: AA (very high quality)</li>
              <li>Initial Price: $97.825</li>
              <li>Note: Lower coupon (2%) due to tax advantage</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Real-World Bond Examples</h4>

            <p><strong>Example 1: Short-term Corporate Bond</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Issuer: Marks and Spencer (retailer)</li>
              <li>Term: 5-year fixed corporate rate bond</li>
              <li>Coupon: 6.125%</li>
              <li>Maturity: July 10, 2024</li>
              <li>
                Price: £87.6 per £100 par (trading below par—indicates higher
                risk)
              </li>
              <li>Issue Size: £400 million</li>
              <li>Minimum Denomination: £1,000</li>
              <li>
                Analysis: Below-par price suggests company is considered riskier
                or interest rates have risen since issuance
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example 2: Long-term Corporate Bond</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Issuer: Tesco (retailer)</li>
              <li>
                Term: 50-year fixed corporate rate bond (very long maturity)
              </li>
              <li>Coupon: 5.2%</li>
              <li>Maturity: March 5, 2057</li>
              <li>Price: £90.75 per £100 par (trading below par)</li>
              <li>Issue Size: £287.5 million</li>
              <li>
                Minimum Denomination: £50,000 (larger denomination =
                institutional bond)
              </li>
              <li>
                Analysis: 50-year bond is very long—duration will be high,
                making price very sensitive to interest rate changes
              </li>
            </ul>

OPTION 4: BOND MARKETS AND TRADING
(For Section - Primary and secondary bond markets, how bonds are traded)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Bond Markets and Trading</h3>

            <p>
              The bond market is one of the largest financial markets in the
              world. Understanding how bonds are issued and traded is essential
              to fixed income trading.
            </p>

            <h4>Primary Bond Market: New Issuances</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Process:</strong> When a bond issuer wants to raise
              capital by selling new bonds to investors.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Steps in Primary Market:</strong></p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Issuer Engagement:</strong> Prospective issuer
                (government or company) engages an investment bank
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Underwriting:</strong> The investment bank may
                underwrite the bonds (agree to buy them if they don't sell)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Offering:</strong> Bank offers bonds for resale to
                brokers or institutional clients
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Distribution:</strong> Bonds are distributed to
                investors at the offering price
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Profit:</strong> Investment banks earn profit on the
                difference between their purchase price and the public offering
                price
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              <strong>Investment Bank Role:</strong> Investment banks act as
              intermediaries, helping issuers sell their bonds and coordinating
              with investors. They take on the risk that bonds may not sell at
              anticipated prices.
            </p>

            <h4>Secondary Bond Market: Trading Existing Bonds</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is the Secondary Market?</strong> The market where
              existing bonds (previously issued) are bought and sold among
              investors.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bonds can be resold multiple times after initial issuance</li>
              <li>
                Price varies based on interest rates, credit quality, and market
                conditions
              </li>
              <li>Provides liquidity—investors can convert bonds to cash</li>
              <li>Larger volume and liquidity than primary market</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Over-the-Counter (OTC) Bond Trading</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> Most bonds trade OTC
              (over-the-counter)—not on centralized exchanges like stock
              exchanges.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Market Participants:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>

                sellers
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Investment Banks:</strong> Trade their own inventory and
                facilitate client trades
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Institutional Investors:</strong> Pension funds, mutual
                funds, insurance companies
              </li>

              <li>Direct negotiation between parties</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Less transparent than exchange trading</li>

              <li>Less price discovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Electronic Bond Trading Platforms</h4>

            <p>

OPTION 5: ADVANCED BOND CONCEPTS AND PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
(For Section - Yield curves, bond strategies, special situations)
================================================================================ -->

            <h3>Advanced Bond Concepts and Applications</h3>

            <p>
              Beyond basic bond mechanics, fixed income professionals use
              advanced concepts for valuation, trading, and risk management.
            </p>

            <h4>Understanding Bond Math Through Examples</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Example Bond: Marks and Spencer Corporate Bond</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coupon: 6.125%</li>
              <li>Maturity: July 10, 2024 (5-year from issuance)</li>
              <li>Price: £87.6 per £100 par</li>
              <li>Denomination: £1,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Calculation Questions:</strong></p>

            <p>
              <strong
                >Question 1: What is the total par value if buying minimum
                amount?</strong
              >
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Minimum denomination: £1,000 par value</li>
              <li>Answer: £1,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Question 2: What is the total coupon value?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Annual coupon: 6.125% × £1,000 = £61.25</li>
              <li>For 5-year bond: £61.25 × 5 = £306.25</li>
              <li>Answer: £306.25</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Question 3: How much at maturity?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bondholder receives par value: £1,000</li>
              <li>
                Plus final coupon (if maturity hasn't passed): £30.625 (6-month
                coupon)
              </li>
              <li>Answer: £1,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Question 4: What is the yield?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Purchase price: £87.6 per £100 = £876 for £1,000 bond</li>
              <li>Yield = Coupon / Price = £61.25 / £876 = 7%</li>
              <li>Answer: 7% (higher than coupon due to discount purchase)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Market Sensitivity: Interest Rate Changes</h4>

            <p><strong>Scenario: Greek Bailout Bond Exercise</strong></p>

            <p>
              <strong
                >Question: Why does optimism about a Greek bailout deal cause
                bond yields to fall?</strong
              >
            </p>

            <p><strong>Answer Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Optimism:</strong> Market becomes more confident Greek
                government will repay debt
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk Perception Falls:</strong> Default risk decreases
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bond Demand Rises:</strong> Investors become willing to
                buy Greek bonds
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prices Rise:</strong> Increased demand pushes bond
                prices higher
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Yields Fall:</strong> Higher bond prices mean lower
                yields
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Relationship:</strong> Price ↑ → Yield ↓ (inverse
                relationship)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Lower yields reduce the
              government's borrowing costs, making refinancing debt easier and
              cheaper.
            </p>

            <h4>Duration and Interest Rate Sensitivity</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Practical Application:</strong> Understanding duration
              helps traders and investors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Predict price changes when interest rates move</li>
              <li>Manage interest rate risk</li>
              <li>Compare bonds with different maturities</li>
              <li>Time bond purchases (buy when rates about to fall)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Long-term Bond Example: Tesco 50-year Bond</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maturity: 2057 (50 years into future)</li>
              <li>Duration: Approximately 15-20 years (very high)</li>
              <li>
                Interest Rate Sensitivity: Very high—price will fluctuate
                significantly with rate changes
              </li>
              <li>
                Trading Implication: Small interest rate moves = large
                profit/loss opportunities
              </li>
              <li>
                Investment Strategy: Only for investors with strong conviction
                on interest rate direction
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Yield Curves and Market Outlook</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What is a Yield Curve?</strong> A graph showing bond
              yields at different maturities (short-term, intermediate,
              long-term).
            </p>

            <p><strong>Normal Yield Curve:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds</li>
              <li>Indicates normal economic conditions</li>
              <li>Investors demand higher yields for tying up money longer</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Inverted Yield Curve:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds
                (unusual)
              </li>
              <li>Often signals economic recession ahead</li>
              <li>
                Investors want to lock in long-term rates before they fall
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Flat Yield Curve:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Yields are similar across all maturities</li>
              <li>Indicates transition in market outlook</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Bond Ladder Strategy</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Concept:</strong> Rather than buying all bonds of one
              maturity, buy bonds maturing at regular intervals.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduces interest rate risk (not all at one maturity)</li>
              <li>Provides regular cash flow as bonds mature</li>
              <li>Allows reinvestment at different rates</li>
              <li>Simpler than active trading</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> Instead of buying $10,000 of 10-year
              bonds, buy:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>$2,000 of 2-year bonds</li>
              <li>$2,000 of 4-year bonds</li>
              <li>$2,000 of 6-year bonds</li>
              <li>$2,000 of 8-year bonds</li>
              <li>$2,000 of 10-year bonds</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fixed Income Trading Strategies</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Carry Trade:</strong> Buy higher-yielding bonds and earn
              the coupon payment while waiting for price appreciation.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Value Play:</strong> Buy bonds trading below intrinsic
              value, expecting price recovery.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Curve Positioning:</strong> Take positions based on
              expected yield curve movements.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Credit Positioning:</strong> Buy higher-yield corporate
              bonds when credit spreads are attractive.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Hedging:</strong> Use government bonds to hedge credit
              risk in corporate bond portfolios.
            </p>

<h3>Derivatives: Foundations and Applications</h3>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Understand the derivatives trading business, including the main products, their uses, and their applications in hedging and speculation.</p>

<h4>What Are Derivatives?</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A derivative is a financial contract whose value is based on the value of underlying assets.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Context:</strong> The concept of derivatives is not new. Derivatives have been around for generations, particularly in the farming industry. For example, a farmer might contract to sell wheat on a particular date at a particular price, protecting against price drops.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Uses:</strong> Today, derivatives have numerous applications, mostly used for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hedging (reducing risk)</li>
    <li>Risk management</li>
    <li>Speculation (betting on price movements)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Underlying Assets:</strong> Derivatives can be written on virtually any underlying asset:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Commodities (wheat, oil, metals)</li>
    <li>Bonds</li>
    <li>Interest Rates</li>
    <li>Foreign Exchange (FX)</li>
    <li>Credit instruments</li>
    <li>Mortgages and Asset-Backed Securities</li>
    <li>Equities</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Derivatives Terms</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Counterparty:</strong> The party taking the other side of the trade</li>
    <li><strong>Strike Price:</strong> The price at which a derivative (option) can be exercised</li>
    <li><strong>Expiry:</strong> The date at which the derivative contract expires</li>
    <li><strong>Hedging:</strong> Insuring yourself against a negative event. Hedging doesn't stop the event from happening, but it reduces its impact</li>
</ul>

<h4>Types of Derivatives</h4>

<p><strong>1. Forwards</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Agree to buy or sell something at a specific point in time in the future for a specific price</li>
    <li>Privately negotiated (OTC)</li>
    <li>Terms are fully negotiable between parties</li>
    <li>Price established at inception of contract</li>
    <li>Higher risk than futures—both sides exposed to credit risk (no clearing house)</li>
    <li>Mainly used for hedging</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I'll purchase 4 tons of wheat from you at $2,000 a ton in six months." Six months later: the buyer gets 4 tons of wheat and pays $8,000.</p>

<p><strong>2. Futures</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A forward contract traded on an exchange</li>
    <li>Highly standardized contracts</li>
    <li>Standard sizes and maturity dates</li>
    <li>Profits/losses settled each day (daily marking-to-market)</li>
    <li>Traded on exchanges like CME, Euronext, LME, ICE Futures Europe, Eurex</li>
    <li>Central counterparty clearing (exchanges act as clearinghouse)</li>
    <li>Lower risk than forwards due to daily settlement</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Chicago SRW Wheat Futures Contract specifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contract Unit: 5,000 bushels (~136 metric tons)</li>
    <li>Price: Cents per bushel</li>
    <li>Settlement: Cash</li>
    <li>Termination: Business day preceding 15th of month</li>
    <li>Currency: USD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Options</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The right (but not obligation) to buy or sell at a specified price on or before a specified date</li>
    <li>Buyer pays a premium for the right</li>
    <li>Value influenced by:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Underlying asset's market price</li>
        <li>Length of contract</li>
        <li>Current volatility of underlying asset</li>
        <li>Supply and demand</li>
        <li>Dividend rate of underlying asset</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Call Option:</strong> Right to buy at a specified price</p>
<p><strong>Put Option:</strong> Right to sell at a specified price</p>

<h4>Option Example</h4>

<p>Google shares trading at $300 per share.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You believe shares will increase</li>
    <li>Purchase a call option with strike price of $315</li>
    <li>Option expires in one month</li>
    <li>Premium: $0.37 per contract (usually sold in 100-share lots)</li>
    <li>Your cash outlay: $37 (for 100 shares)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scenario: Stock rises to $320</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>You exercise call option, buying at $315</li>
    <li>Immediately sell at market price of $320</li>
    <li>Profit per share: $5.00 (sale) minus $0.37 (premium) = $4.63</li>
    <li>Total profit: $4.63 × 100 shares = $463</li>
</ul>

<h4>Option Risks and Benefits</h4>

<p><strong>Buying Call Options</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Benefit: If stock price rises above strike, you profit</li>
    <li>Risk: Limited to the premium paid. If stock doesn't rise above strike, you lose only the premium</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Selling Call Options (Writing)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Benefit: Maximum profit is the premium received</li>
    <li>Risk: Potentially unlimited. If stock price soars, you must sell at agreed strike price, missing profits</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Buying Put Options</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Used when you believe underlying stock will fall</li>
    <li>Right to sell shares at option's higher price</li>
    <li>Can then buy them back at lower market price</li>
    <li>Risk: Limited to the loss of the premium if option not exercised</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Selling Put Options (Writing)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Seller believes asset will increase in value</li>
    <li>Maximum profit: Premium received</li>
    <li>Loss: Having to buy shares at strike price above current market value</li>
</ul>

<h4>Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model</h4>

<p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The Black-Scholes model and its variants assume stock prices follow a lognormal distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Formula Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>C = call option price</li>
    <li>N = CDF (cumulative distribution function) of normal distribution</li>
    <li>S_t = spot price of asset</li>
    <li>K = strike price</li>
    <li>r = risk-free interest rate</li>
    <li>t = time to maturity</li>
    <li>σ (sigma) = volatility of the asset</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Options with optionality do not react to market prices in a linear manner—both in value and in calculated risk position.</p>

<h4>4. Swaps</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A contract to exchange a series of cash flows at specific points in the future based on a specific principal amount.</p>

<p><strong>Key Characteristic:</strong> Swaps are zero-sum games—there is always a winner and a loser.</p>

<h4>Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)</h4>

<p><strong>How They Work:</strong> Two parties exchange interest payments on a notional principal amount.</p>

<p><strong>Example Scenario:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Notional Value: £1,000,000</li>
    <li>LIBOR Rate: 5%</li>
    <li>Bob holds a bond paying LIBOR + 1% (variable rate)</li>
    <li>Alice holds a bond paying 6% (fixed rate)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Swap Agreement:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bob pays Alice 5.5%</li>
    <li>Alice pays Bob 6%</li>
    <li>Net: Alice pays Bob 0.5% ($5,000 annually)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Each Party Participates:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bob:</strong> Believes LIBOR will decrease. Wants more predictable fixed rate to hedge market risk</li>
    <li><strong>Alice:</strong> Believes LIBOR will increase. Speculator seeking higher returns</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Swap Legs:</strong> The cash flows exchanged are referred to as "legs"</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fixed Leg:</strong> Pays fixed interest rate agreed at outset</li>
    <li><strong>Floating Leg:</strong> Linked to future interest rate levels (e.g., LIBOR)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vanilla Swap:</strong> Most common type—floating interest rate exchanged for fixed rate (or vice versa)</p>

<h4>Comparative Advantage in Interest Rate Swaps</h4>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Company A: Can borrow fixed at 10% or floating at LIBOR + 0.35%</li>
    <li>Company B: Can borrow fixed at 11.25% or floating at LIBOR + 1.0%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Company A has comparative advantage in fixed-rate borrowing (better at 10% vs 11.25%)</li>
    <li>Company B has comparative advantage in floating-rate borrowing (better at LIBOR + 1.0% vs LIBOR + 0.35%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Each company borrows at its advantage, then they swap via IRS to achieve better rates for both.</p>

<h4>5. Swaptions</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A contract giving the right (but not obligation) to enter into a swap agreement at a specific price at a particular point in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Analogy:</strong> A swaption is to a swap what an option is to a stock.</p>

<p><strong>Two Types:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Payer Swaption:</strong> Right to enter swap where you pay fixed rate and receive floating rate</li>
    <li><strong>Receiver Swaption:</strong> Right to enter swap where you receive fixed rate and pay floating rate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>OTC (over-the-counter) and unstandardized</li>
    <li>Terms fully negotiated between buyer and seller</li>
    <li>Commercial banks are main market makers</li>
    <li>Only banks can effectively manage portfolios of swaptions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Credit Derivatives: Credit Default Swaps (CDS)</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A contract to insure the credit risk of an underlying bond for an agreed fee over an agreed amount of time.</p>

<p><strong>How a CDS Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Buyer enters CDS contract and pays premium to seller</li>
    <li>Seller agrees that upon credit event, they will pay face value plus remaining interest to buyer</li>
    <li>Contract expires if bond matures without credit event occurring</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Types of CDS:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Single Name CDS: Protection on one bond issuer</li>
    <li>Basket CDS: Protection on multiple issuers</li>
    <li>Index CDS: Protection on index of bonds</li>
</ul>

<h4>CDS Participants</h4>

<p><strong>Protection Seller Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Earns investment income with no funding cost</li>
    <li>Gains customized, synthetic access to risky bond exposure</li>
    <li>Often protection tenor is shorter than bond tenor, limiting long-term exposure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Protection Buyer Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Hedges default risk on reference asset (bond)</li>
    <li>Can maintain client relationships while reducing credit risk</li>
</ul>

<h4>CDS Bank Use Case</h4>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Bank lends £10 million to corporate client</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loan rate: LIBOR + 65 basis points (0.65%)</li>
    <li>Bank buys £10 million default protection at 50 basis points (0.50%)</li>
    <li>Net benefit: 15 basis points (0.15%) = £15,000 annually</li>
    <li>Objectives achieved:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain relationship with client</li>
        <li>Reduce credit risk on new loan</li>
        <li>Generate net revenue</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Credit Events Triggering CDS</h4>

<p>A CDS is triggered when the following events occur:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> Issuer becomes insolvent or unable to pay debts</li>
    <li><strong>Failure to Pay:</strong> Issuer defaults on debt payments</li>
    <li><strong>Debt Restructuring:</strong> Configuration of debt obligations is changed negatively for credit holder</li>
    <li><strong>Obligation Acceleration:</strong> Debt payment is scheduled before maturity date</li>
    <li><strong>Repudiation/Moratorium:</strong> Issuer refuses to pay principal and interest</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An investment similar to a bond made up of a bundle of home loans bought from the banks that issued them.</p>

<p><strong>How They Work:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Investors receive periodic payments similar to bond coupons</li>
    <li>Payments come from monthly mortgage payments of underlying homeowners</li>
    <li>Investors are purchasing the cash flow from underlying mortgages</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MBS-Specific Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Default Risk:</strong> Homeowners may default due to job loss, bankruptcy, or other hardships</li>
    <li><strong>Prepayment Risk:</strong> As interest rates decrease, mortgage-owners refinance or prepay. Similar to a callable bond—investors lose higher-rate payments</li>
    <li><strong>Correlation Risk:</strong> If mortgage defaults are highly correlated (geographic area, housing market collapse), diversification benefit is lost</li>
    <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> MBS investors are primarily institutional. Smaller lots difficult to sell. Large positions difficult to liquidate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Principal-Agent Problem in Lending</h4>

<p><strong>Historical Model:</strong> Commercial banks underwrote loans and held them until maturity, giving them incentive to minimize credit risk.</p>

<p><strong>Post-1990s Model: Originate-to-Distribute</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Strong demand from investment banks for mortgage pools enabled originators to resell quickly</li>
    <li>Originators no longer held credit risk</li>
    <li>Investment banks purchased mortgage pools based on limited metrics (credit scores, LTV ratio)</li>
    <li>Problem: Originators became agents of investors, originating loans without caring about credit quality</li>
    <li>Result: This principal-agent problem encouraged subprime lending</li>
    <li>Rating agencies underestimated MBS risks</li>
</ul>

<h4>MBS and the 2008 Financial Crisis</h4>

<p><strong>Timeline of Crisis:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-2006:</strong> Rapid increase in home prices caused banks to lower lending standards</li>
    <li><strong>2006:</strong> Housing prices peaked; quality of all MBS-backed securities declined, ratings became meaningless</li>
    <li><strong>2007-2008:</strong> Subprime borrowers began defaulting as housing market collapsed</li>
    <li><strong>2008:</strong> More people "walked away" from mortgages—homes worth less than mortgage owed</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Large non-payments meant MBS and CDOs greatly overvalued</li>
    <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> Losses piled up. Institutional investors and banks tried and failed to unload bad MBS investments</li>
    <li><strong>System Risk:</strong> Credit tightened; banks at risk of insolvency</li>
</ul>

<h4>Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A security collateralized by a pool of assets (not mortgages).</p>

<p><strong>Examples of Underlying Assets:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Credit card debt</li>
    <li>Home equity loans</li>
    <li>Student loans</li>
    <li>Automotive loans</li>
    <li>Movie revenues</li>
    <li>Leases and receivables</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Securitization Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Loan Originators:</strong> Create loans (credit card debt, auto loans, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>SPV Creation:</strong> Originators sell to SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)—an orphan company created to spread risks</li>
    <li><strong>SPV Function:</strong> Provides "remoteness" for originator from liability. SPV sells to trust</li>
    <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Repackages loans as interest-bearing securities</li>
    <li><strong>Investors:</strong> Receive cash flows from underlying pool of loans</li>
    <li><strong>Tranches:</strong> Securities usually issued in different tranches by risk level</li>
    <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Paid to security providers throughout process</li>
</ol>

<h4>Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Complex asset-backed securities containing mortgage-backed assets, non-mortgage assets, or a combination. Assets become collateral if loans default.</p>

<p><strong>Types:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CLO (Collateralized Loan Obligation):</strong> Often corporate loans with low credit ratings</li>
    <li><strong>CBO (Collateralized Bond Obligation):</strong> Bond-backed by pool of junk bonds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tranches:</strong> Pieces of the pooled collection of securities, usually debt instruments.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Split by risk or other characteristics to make marketable</li>
    <li>Senior Tranches: Higher credit ratings, lowest yields, repaid first in default</li>
    <li>Junior Tranches: Lower credit ratings, higher yields, repaid last in default</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Structure Benefit:</strong> Allows investors of different risk appetites to invest. Senior tranches suitable for conservative investors; junior tranches for risk-seeking investors.</p>

<h4>Complexity of CDOs</h4>

<p><strong>Structure:</strong> CDOs consist of diverse loans and debt instruments repackaged into discrete classes based on credit risk.</p>

<p><strong>Example Structure:</strong> An investment bank gathers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mortgages</li>
    <li>Corporate bonds</li>
    <li>Other debt instruments</li>
</ul>

<p>Then repackages into different tranches with varying risk profiles and returns.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The complexity made it difficult for investors and regulators to fully understand underlying risks, contributing to 2008 financial crisis.</p>

<h3>Currency and Foreign Exchange Markets</h3>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Understand the foreign exchange (FX) business, how currencies are traded, and the mechanisms for managing foreign exchange risk.</p>

<h4>What is Foreign Exchange (FX)?</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The marketplace in which various national currencies are traded.</p>

<p><strong>Scale:</strong> The forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world, with trillions of dollars traded per day.</p>

<p><strong>Trading Hours:</strong> 24-hour trading available Sunday–Friday (GMT). However, there are three main sessions across Asia, Europe, and the US.</p>

<p><strong>Session Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Although sessions overlap, main currencies trade primarily in their regional sessions</li>
    <li>Example: USD trading does most volume during US trading session</li>
    <li>Tokyo session (Asia Pacific): Trades Asian currencies, USD</li>
    <li>London session (Europe): Trades EUR, GBP, trades highest volume</li>
    <li>New York session (US): Trades USD, highest volatility</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Market Structure:</strong> No centralized location. It is an electronic network of banks, brokers, institutions, and individual traders.</p>

<p><strong>Trading Instruments:</strong> Forwards and futures can be used to trade in the FX market, in addition to spot transactions.</p>

<h4>How FX Trading Works</h4>

<p><strong>Spot Market:</strong> The marketplace where financial instruments such as commodities, currencies, and securities are traded for immediate delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Settlement Terms:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Standard:</strong> FX spot trades settle on a T+2 basis (two business days after trade)</li>
    <li><strong>Exception:</strong> USD/CAD settles in 1 business day</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trading Lots:</strong> Currency is traded in various sized lots</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Micro lot:</strong> 1,000 units of your currency</li>
    <li><strong>Mini lot:</strong> 10,000 units of your base currency</li>
    <li><strong>Standard lot:</strong> 100,000 units of your base currency</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Base Currency:</strong> The currency your account is funded in. This is the reference currency for all transactions.</p>

<h4>Currency Pairs</h4>

<p><strong>How Trading Works:</strong> Currency trading is done in pairs. You buy one currency and simultaneously sell another.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Trade EUR/USD: Buy euros, sell US dollars</li>
    <li>Bet that euro will strengthen against dollar</li>
    <li>Profit if euro appreciates relative to dollar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Market Concentration:</strong> Majority of volume in currency trading is confined to only 18 currency pairs.</p>

<p><strong>Eight Most Traded Currencies:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>USD (US Dollar) – Most traded globally</li>
    <li>EUR (Euro) – Second most traded</li>
    <li>GBP (British Pound) – Major currency</li>
    <li>JPY (Japanese Yen) – Major currency</li>
    <li>CHF (Swiss Franc) – Safe haven currency</li>
    <li>CAD (Canadian Dollar)</li>
    <li>AUD (Australian Dollar)</li>
    <li>NZD (New Zealand Dollar)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major Currency Pairs:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>EUR/USD – Most traded pair</li>
    <li>USD/JPY – Second most traded</li>
    <li>GBP/USD</li>
    <li>USD/CHF</li>
    <li>AUD/USD</li>
    <li>USD/CAD</li>

<h4>Challenges in FX Trading</h4>

<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> With equity trading, you are making a decision based on one company's value. With FX, you are valuing an entire country!</p>

<p><strong>Long-Term Analysis:</strong> Market analysis to predict long-term trends is complex. Requires understanding of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>National economic policies</li>
    <li>Interest rate differentials</li>
    <li>Trade balances</li>
    <li>Political stability</li>
    <li>Inflation rates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Short-Term Trading:</strong> Some traders focus strictly on short-term trading based on news releases.</p>

<p><strong>Key Economic Indicators That Move Markets:</strong> Traders monitor these closely for immediate market moves:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP):</strong> US employment data—most volatile indicator</li>
    <li><strong>2. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI):</strong> Manufacturing activity</li>
    <li><strong>3. Consumer Price Index (CPI):</strong> Inflation measure</li>
    <li><strong>4. Retail Sales:</strong> Consumer spending patterns</li>
    <li><strong>5. Durable Goods Orders:</strong> Long-term consumer spending</li>
    <li><strong>6. Federal Reserve Announcements:</strong> Even Fed Chairman's comments on interest rates can trigger market moves</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Volatility Sources:</strong> Currency markets react quickly to unexpected news, making FX trading risky but also offering opportunities.</p>

<h4>FX Trading Venues</h4>

<p><strong>Electronic Network:</strong> FX trading is conducted across an electronic network rather than having a physical location.</p>

<p><strong>Major Trading Platforms and Brokers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HotSpot:</strong> Electronic trading platform for foreign exchange</li>
    <li><strong>CurrenEx:</strong> Electronic currency trading system</li>
    <li><strong>FXall:</strong> Bloomberg's FX trading platform</li>
    <li><strong>BrokerTec:</strong> Fixed income and FX trading platform</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major Banks and Dealers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Deutsche Bank</li>
    <li>Morgan Stanley</li>
    <li>Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML)</li>
    <li>Other major investment banks and FX specialists</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Market Structure:</strong> These platforms and institutions act as market makers, providing liquidity and narrower bid-ask spreads for traders.</p>

<h4>Interest Rate Parity (IRP) and Forward Rates</h4>

<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Interest Rate Parity explains the relationship between spot exchange rates, forward exchange rates, and interest rates in two countries.</p>

<p><strong>Principle:</strong> Forward exchange rate should adjust for interest rate differences between two countries, so arbitrage opportunities do not exist.</p>

<p><strong>Example Scenario:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Starting Position:</strong> You have $1,000,000 USD and want to invest for 90 days</li>
    <li><strong>Spot Rate:</strong> 1 USD = 1.4800 Swiss Francs (SF)</li>
    <li><strong>USD Interest Rate:</strong> 8% per annum (2% for 90 days)</li>
    <li><strong>CHF Interest Rate:</strong> 4% per annum (1% for 90 days)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Two Strategies:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strategy 1: Invest in USD</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Invest $1,000,000 at 2% for 90 days</li>
    <li>Receive: $1,020,000</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strategy 2: Convert to CHF, Invest, Convert Back</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Convert $1,000,000 to CHF at spot (1.4800): SF 1,480,000</li>
    <li>Invest SF 1,480,000 at 1% for 90 days: SF 1,494,800</li>
    <li>Convert back at forward rate (1.4655): $1,019,993</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Both strategies yield approximately equal returns ($1,020,000 vs $1,019,993), demonstrating interest rate parity.</p>

<p><strong>Forward Rate Formula:</strong> The forward rate adjusts to eliminate arbitrage opportunities between investing in each currency.</p>

<h4>FX Swaps</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A transaction in which two parties exchange principal amounts in different currencies at the spot rate, then exchange them back at a forward rate.</p>

<p><strong>How an FX Swap Works:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Upfront (Day 0):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Party A needs $1 million</li>
    <li>Party B has £800,000</li>
    <li>Exchange at spot rate: GBP/USD = 1.25</li>
    <li>Party A gives £800,000, receives $1 million</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At Contract Maturity (e.g., 90 days later):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Exchange back at forward rate: GBP/USD = 2.0</li>
    <li>Party A returns $1 million, receives £500,000</li>
    <li>Or: equivalent value exchanged based on forward rate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Allows parties to borrow in needed currency while managing exchange rate risk.</p>

<p><strong>No Interest Payments:</strong> FX swaps typically involve no interest payments—only principal exchange at spot and forward rates.</p>

<h4>Currency Swaps (Cross-Currency Swaps)</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A contract to exchange principal amounts in different currencies at the outset, exchange interest payments during the term, then re-exchange principal at maturity.</p>

<p><strong>Key Difference from FX Swaps:</strong> Currency swaps include interest payments, while FX swaps typically do not.</p>

<p><strong>How a Currency Swap Works:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Upfront (Day 0):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Exchange principal: $1 million ↔ £800,000</li>
    <li>Exchange occurs at spot rate (GBP/USD = 1.25)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>During Contract Term (Regular Payments):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Party A pays interest in GBP (in pounds)</li>
    <li>Party B pays interest in USD (in dollars)</li>
    <li>Interest rates typically fixed or floating, based on agreement</li>
    <li>Payments linked to interest rates in each currency</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At Contract Maturity:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Re-exchange principal amounts (at original spot rate or agreed forward rate)</li>
    <li>Each party receives back their original currency</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Allows companies to borrow in foreign currency at more favorable rates than if borrowing directly from local market.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Protects against both exchange rate risk AND interest rate risk.</p>

<h4>FX Swaps vs. Currency Swaps</h4>

<p><strong>FX Swap Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>No exchange of interest during contract term</li>
    <li>Differing amounts of funds exchanged at end (different at forward rate than at spot)</li>
    <li>Typically used to offset exchange rate risk only</li>
    <li>Simpler structure, shorter duration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Currency Swap Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Interest payments exchanged throughout contract term</li>
    <li>Principal and interest payments exchanged</li>
    <li>Typically used to offset both exchange rate AND interest rate risk</li>
    <li>More complex, longer duration (often multi-year)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When to Use Each:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>FX Swaps: Short-term funding needs in foreign currency</li>
    <li>Currency Swaps: Long-term borrowing in foreign currency with interest rate exposure</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exchange Rate Pass-Through</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The degree to which changes in exchange rates are reflected in the prices of imported and exported goods.</p>

<p><strong>Concept:</strong> When a currency appreciates or depreciates, import and export prices change, but not necessarily proportionally.</p>

<p><strong>Example Scenario: BMW Automobile</strong></p>

<p><strong>Initial Situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>BMW made in Germany</li>
    <li>Price in euros: €28,000</li>
    <li>Spot rate: EUR/USD = 1.25</li>
    <li>US price: $35,000 (€28,000 × 1.25)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Currency Movement:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Euro appreciates by 20%</li>
    <li>New spot rate: EUR/USD = 1.50</li>
    <li>Without pass-through adjustment: €28,000 × 1.50 = $42,000</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Happens in Practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>BMW doesn't want to price themselves out of US market</li>
    <li>BMW accepts lower euro profits</li>
    <li>BMW reduces euro price or accepts margin compression</li>
    <li>US price increases to only $40,000 (not $42,000)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pass-Through Calculation:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Price increase: $40,000 - $35,000 = $5,000</li>
    <li>Exchange rate change: 20%</li>
    <li>Degree of pass-through: $5,000 / $7,000 = 71%</li>
    <li>Only 71% of exchange rate change passed through to prices</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Not 100% Pass-Through?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Companies want to maintain market share</li>
    <li>Price elasticity of demand—higher prices reduce sales volume</li>
    <li>Competition from other manufacturers</li>
    <li>Overseas production to hedge currency moves</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Economic Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Partial pass-through reduces export competitiveness after currency appreciation</li>
    <li>Imports become more expensive but not as much as exchange rate change suggests</li>
    <li>Trade balances affected differently than pure exchange rate changes would indicate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Takeaways for FX Trading</h4>

<ul>
    <li>FX is the world's largest financial market with 24-hour trading</li>
    <li>Trading happens in currency pairs on electronic networks</li>
    <li>Economic data releases drive short-term volatility</li>
    <li>Interest rate differentials affect forward rates (IRP)</li>
    <li>FX Swaps manage short-term currency exposure</li>
    <li>Currency Swaps manage long-term currency and interest rate exposure</li>
    <li>Exchange rate pass-through is incomplete—companies manage pricing strategically</li>
    <li>FX trading requires understanding macro factors: interest rates, inflation, trade, politics</li>

<h3>Treasury Operations and Bank Liquidity Management</h3>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Understand the treasury business function in a bank, including how banks manage their own capital, liquidity, and funding in a global environment.</p>

<h4>What is Treasury?</h4>

<p><strong>Core Function:</strong> The treasury department controls and manages the bank's own money.</p>

<p><strong>Operating Environment:</strong> Treasury operates in a global environment characterized by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Market volatility</li>
    <li>Ever-increasing regulation</li>
    <li>Multiple currencies and time zones</li>
    <li>Complex funding requirements</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong> Treasury manages three critical functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Funding:</strong> Ensuring the bank has sufficient capital to operate</li>
    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Ensuring day-to-day payment obligations can be met</li>
    <li><strong>Capital Management:</strong> Optimizing returns while meeting regulatory requirements</li>
</ul>

<h4>Capital Management</h4>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Structure the bank's funds to ensure returns are maximized whilst meeting regulatory standards.</p>

<p><strong>Investment Profile Timelines:</strong> Treasury manages funds across different time horizons:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Short-Term:</strong> Days to weeks. Highest liquidity required</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Term:</strong> Weeks to months. Moderate liquidity</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Years. Lower liquidity needs, potential for higher returns</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Global Currency Positioning:</strong> Global banks position themselves in multiple currencies to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Efficiently fund transactions across the bank in those currencies</li>
    <li>Benefit from currency movements</li>
    <li>Reduce overall funding costs</li>
    <li>Support international client operations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Treasury Stakeholders</h4>

<p><strong>Internal Stakeholders:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Investors</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Treasury must advertise strength and stability of the company</li>
    <li>Capital management decisions impact stock price and investor confidence</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regulators</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Treasury must comply with required regulatory standards</li>
    <li>Capital ratios, liquidity requirements, stress tests</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Finance Department</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Need to know end-to-end cost of every transaction</li>
    <li>Treasury provides funding cost allocation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trading Desks</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Need to understand implications of trades on bank's capital</li>
    <li>Treasury advises on capital impact of trading activity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Risk Department</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Requires development of stress-testing models</li>
    <li>Treasury provides inputs for risk calculations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technology Department</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Needs data for auto-calculation and distribution of recharge metrics</li>
    <li>Treasury provides funding cost data to systems</li>
</ul>

<h4>Execution Services</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Treasury manages the bank's requirement to execute transactions in multiple currencies.</p>

<p><strong>Typical Scenario:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Front office team (e.g., capital financing) agrees to business loan in euros</li>
    <li>Counterparty needs euros purchased on the money market</li>
    <li>Treasury execution services facilitate the transaction</li>
    <li>Treasury advises on cost (what exchange rate to offer)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example Transaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bank needs $300 million USD</li>
    <li>Treasury determines: "How many £ will it take to buy $300 million today?"</li>
    <li>Based on current FX rates and market conditions</li>
    <li>Treasury executes the transaction efficiently</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interbank Lending</h4>

<p><strong>What is Interbank Lending?</strong> Banks lend assets to each other for specified periods, usually short-term or overnight.</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bank A needs liquidity, borrows from Bank B</li>
    <li>Interest is calculated using the interbank rate</li>
    <li>Loan period can be as short as one day (overnight)</li>
    <li>Repayment at end of loan period plus interest</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Interbank Rates:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The rate at which banks can borrow from each other</li>
    <li>Driven by availability of money in the market</li>
    <li>More lenders in market = lower rates</li>
    <li>Fewer lenders in market = higher rates</li>
    <li>Common interbank rates include ICE LIBOR, EURIBOR, US Dollar LIBOR</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Credit Ratings Impact:</strong> Banks have credit ratings that impact the rate they pay for borrowing.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Higher-rated banks pay lower rates</li>
    <li>Lower-rated banks pay higher rates</li>
    <li>Similar to corporate bond spreads</li>
</ul>

<h4>LIBOR – London Interbank Offered Rate</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A benchmark rate for currency borrowing.</p>

<p><strong>How LIBOR is Calculated:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Daily rate submissions from 11-17 contributor banks</li>
    <li>Each bank answers: "At what rate could you borrow funds in a reasonable market size just prior to 11am London time?"</li>
    <li>The rate is intended to be representative of average rate a bank could borrow at in London money market</li>
    <li>Rates published by ICE (Intercontinental Exchange)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LIBOR Quotation:</strong> Annualized interest rate</p>
<ul>
    <li>Example: 1-month GBP LIBOR at 2.00000% = 2% divided by 365 days</li>
    <li>Available in multiple currencies (GBP, USD, EUR, JPY, CHF, etc.)</li>
    <li>Available in multiple tenors (overnight, 1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LIBOR Uses:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Pricing benchmark for bank loans</li>
    <li>Reference rate for interest rate derivatives</li>
    <li>Basis for interbank lending rates</li>
    <li>Used in mortgages ("Loan at LIBOR + 2.5%")</li>
</ul>

<h4>LIBOR History and Scandals</h4>

<p><strong>Pre-2012: Problems with LIBOR</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Little regulatory oversight of rate submissions</li>
    <li>Traders submitted rates that would benefit their trading positions</li>
    <li>Rates were supposed to reflect actual rates banks could borrow at</li>
    <li>Instead, rates submitted were sometimes designed to profit rate swap traders</li>
    <li>Collusion occurred across different banks to collectively adjust rates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2012: LIBOR Rigging Scandal</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered that multiple banks had manipulated LIBOR submissions</li>
    <li>Massive fines imposed on banks involved</li>
    <li>Criminal prosecutions launched</li>
    <li>Result: Loss of confidence in LIBOR</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Post-2012: New Governance Structure (ICE LIBOR)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Rates now based on actual transactions with records kept</li>
    <li>Criminal sanctions in place to enable prosecution for manipulation</li>
    <li>Increased regulatory oversight and verification</li>
    <li>Better methodology to prevent manipulation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ongoing Transition:</strong> Financial industry transitioning away from LIBOR to new benchmark rates (SOFR in US, SONIA in UK) due to persistent sustainability concerns.</p>

<h4>Funding</h4>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Funding teams ensure the investment bank has sufficient liquidity to meet payment obligations on a daily basis.</p>

<p><strong>Key Requirement:</strong> Sufficient cash must be available in the correct currencies in all required locations to ensure trades can be settled as agreed.</p>

<p><strong>Liquidity Holdings:</strong> Banks hold a proportion of highly liquid assets to meet short-term liabilities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cash (currency)</li>
    <li>FX swaps (can convert to other currencies quickly)</li>
    <li>Overnight deposits (can withdraw next day)</li>
    <li>Government securities (easily traded)</li>
    <li>Central bank facilities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Daily Liquidity Management:</strong> Treasury must forecast:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expected inflows and outflows each day</li>
    <li>Minimum liquidity cushion needed</li>
    <li>Optimal currency mix</li>
    <li>Timing of funding activities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Funding Sources:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Customer deposits</li>
    <li>Wholesale funding (bonds, CDs)</li>
    <li>Interbank lending</li>
    <li>Central bank facilities (repos, discount window)</li>
    <li>Asset sales (if needed)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Stress Testing</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Assessment of how well a bank can withstand market shocks and liquidity disruption.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Context:</strong> After 2008 financial crisis, banks became subject to mandatory stress testing.</p>

<p><strong>Regulatory Stress Tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bank of England (BoE):</strong> Introduced stress testing of UK banks in 2014</li>
    <li><strong>Federal Reserve (US):</strong> Stress testing as part of Dodd Frank regulation</li>
    <li><strong>Other Regulators:</strong> Most major financial regulators now require stress tests</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stress Test Scenarios:</strong> Banks model performance under hypothetical adverse conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Severe economic recession</li>
    <li>Market volatility and credit crises</li>
    <li>Funding market disruption</li>
    <li>Commodity price shocks</li>
    <li>Interest rate spikes or crashes</li>
    <li>Counterparty defaults</li>
</ul>

<h4>Capital Ratios</h4>

<p><strong>Core Tier 1 Capital:</strong> Shareholders' equity and retained earnings</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most important capital measure</li>
    <li>The "purest" form of capital</li>
    <li>Highest-quality loss-absorbing capacity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Core Tier 1 Capital Ratio:</strong> The ratio of a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets.</p>

<p><strong>BoE Hurdle Rate (2014):</strong> Minimum Core Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.5%</p>
<ul>
    <li>Later adjusted (2016) to reflect differences required by globally systemically important banks</li>
    <li>Systemically important banks required to hold more capital</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regulatory Minimum:</strong> Banks must maintain capital above regulatory minimums at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Stress Test Results:</strong> Must demonstrate adequate capital even under severe stress scenarios.</p>

<h4>Treasury's Role in Risk Management</h4>

<p><strong>Market Risk Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor foreign exchange exposure</li>
    <li>Hedge interest rate risk</li>
    <li>Manage liquidity risk</li>
    <li>Monitor credit risk from counterparties</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain minimum capital ratios</li>
    <li>Meet liquidity coverage ratios (LCR)</li>
    <li>Monitor loan-to-deposit ratios</li>
    <li>Comply with concentration limits</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Performance Monitoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Track funding costs</li>
    <li>Monitor return on capital</li>
    <li>Measure internal transfer pricing accuracy</li>
    <li>Report to management and regulators</li>
</ul>

<h4>Treasury Technology</h4>

<p><strong>Systems Required:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Cash management systems (track inflows/outflows)</li>
    <li>Treasury management systems (optimize funding)</li>
    <li>Risk measurement systems (VaR, stress testing)</li>
    <li>Market data feeds (FX rates, interest rates)</li>
    <li>Regulatory reporting systems</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real-Time Management:</strong> Treasury often operates 24/5 (Monday-Friday, around the clock) to manage global funding needs across time zones.</p>

<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Treasury is critical to bank operations</li>
    <li>Management of capital, liquidity, and funding is essential</li>
    <li>Interbank lending and LIBOR are key funding mechanisms</li>
    <li>Regulatory capital requirements constrain operations</li>
    <li>Stress testing ensures resilience to market shocks</li>
    <li>Risk management is integral to treasury function</li>

<h3>Financial Regulation and Risk Management</h3>

<p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Understand regulatory frameworks governing financial markets, types of risks banks face, and regulatory approaches to risk management.</p>

<h4>Global Regulatory Framework</h4>

<p><strong>International Coordination:</strong> Financial regulation is coordinated globally across major economic centers.</p>

<p><strong>Canada</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bank of Canada (BoC) – Central bank</li>
    <li>Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) – Banking regulator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bank of England (BoE) – Central bank</li>
    <li>Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – Conduct and market regulator</li>
    <li>Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) – Prudential/safety regulator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>United States</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Federal Reserve System (The Fed) – Central bank</li>
    <li>Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) – Securities regulator</li>
    <li>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – Derivatives regulator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>European Union</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>European Central Bank (ECB) – Central bank</li>

    <li>European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) – Securities regulator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hong Kong</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) – Securities regulator</li>
    <li>Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) – Central bank</li>
</ul>

<h4>Regulator Objectives</h4>

<p><strong>Common Goals Across Regulators:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Systemic stability (prevent financial system collapse)</li>
    <li>Consumer/investor protection (ensure fair treatment)</li>
    <li>Market transparency (ensure informed decision-making)</li>
    <li>Anti-fraud and market abuse prevention</li>
    <li>Financial crime prevention (money laundering, terrorist financing)</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Scale of Modern Regulation</h4>

<p><strong>Current Era:</strong> We are now in an era of maximum regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Regulatory Expansion:</strong> Since the 2008 financial crisis, regulatory requirements have expanded dramatically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>New agencies created (FSOC in US, ESMA in EU, PRA in UK)</li>
    <li>Capital requirements increased (Basel III)</li>
    <li>Liquidity requirements added (LCR, NSFR)</li>
    <li>Stress testing mandated</li>
    <li>Derivatives regulation expanded (EMIR, MiFID II, Dodd-Frank)</li>
    <li>Conduct rules tightened</li>
</ul>

<h4>Layers of Regulation</h4>

<p><strong>Multiple Jurisdictions:</strong> Regulation can be applied at multiple levels, and all rules must be complied with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>International Level:</strong> Basel Committee standards, IOSCO principles</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Level:</strong> EU directives, regional regulatory bodies</li>
    <li><strong>National Level:</strong> National regulators (Fed, FCA, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Local Level:</strong> State or provincial regulations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> A global bank must comply with regulations from multiple jurisdictions simultaneously, often with conflicting rules.</p>

<h4>Recent Regulatory Timeline</h4>

<p><strong>Key Regulations Introduced (2010-2019):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2010:</strong> FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act)</li>
    <li><strong>2010:</strong> Dodd-Frank Legislation (US)</li>
    <li><strong>2011:</strong> AIFMD (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive)</li>
    <li><strong>2012:</strong> Financial Services Act (UK)</li>
    <li><strong>2013:</strong> Capital Requirements Directive IV (Europe)</li>
    <li><strong>2014:</strong> EMIR Transaction Reporting</li>
    <li><strong>2016:</strong> Money Market Fund Reform</li>
    <li><strong>2017:</strong> Volcker Rule (enforcement)</li>
    <li><strong>2018:</strong> MiFID II / MIFIR (Markets in Financial Instruments)</li>
    <li><strong>2019:</strong> Basel III / Ring Fencing (separation of banking)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Value at Risk (VaR)</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The loss in value of a portfolio that can be expected over a given period of time (e.g., 1 day) with a probability not exceeding a given number (e.g., 5%).</p>

<p><strong>Mathematical Expression:</strong> P(Portfolio Loss ≤ VaR) = K, where K = given probability</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> "We expect that our worst daily loss should not exceed 5% on 99% of occasions if we invest £5,000 in this asset."</p>

<p><strong>Key Considerations in VaR:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Time period holding the asset (1-day, 10-day, etc.)</li>
    <li>Confidence level in the asset (95%, 99%, etc.)</li>
    <li>Loss amount ($1 million, £10 million, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>VaR in Market Risk Capital Requirements</h4>

<p><strong>Regulatory Formula:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Regulatory Capital = Market Risk Capital + Specific Risk Capital + Counterparty Risk Capital</li>
    <li>Market Risk Capital = Max [Average of 10-Day 99% VaR × Multiplier, yesterday's 10-Day 99% VaR]</li>
    <li>Multiplier is >3, depending on regulatory requirement</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data Requirements:</strong> Regulators require at least one year of historical data.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation Methods:</strong> Banks can use three methods to calculate VaR:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Historical Simulation:</strong> Use past price movements to estimate future outcomes</li>
    <li><strong>Variance/Covariance Method:</strong> Assume normal distribution, use correlation and volatility</li>
    <li><strong>Monte Carlo Simulation:</strong> Random simulation of many scenarios</li>
</ul>

<h4>Credit Risk</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The risk of a debt issuer defaulting on a credit obligation.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences of Default:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Loss of principal investment</li>
    <li>Loss of expected cash flows</li>
    <li>Potential recovery of partial value (collateral, bankruptcy proceedings)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Upfront assessment of credit risk of debt issuers</li>
    <li>Continual monitoring of credit quality</li>
    <li>Diversification across counterparties</li>
    <li>Collateral requirements</li>
    <li>Credit derivatives (CDS)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of Credit Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Company unable to repay asset-secured debt (e.g., equipment loan)</li>
    <li>Bond issuer failing to pay coupon or principal when due</li>
    <li>Consumer defaulting on mortgage, credit card, or personal loan</li>
</ul>

<h4>Credit Rating Agencies</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Rate the creditworthiness of companies, products, and countries. They answer: "How likely are they to repay their loan?"</p>

<p><strong>Examples of Ratings:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>USA Sovereign Bond: Aaa (Moody's) / AAA (S&P), Stable outlook</li>
    <li>UK Sovereign: Aa / AA, Stable outlook</li>
    <li>Greek Government: BB- / BB, Positive outlook (recovering from crisis)</li>
    <li>Mexico Sovereign: BBB+, Negative outlook</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rating Scale:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AAA/Aaa:</strong> Highest quality, lowest risk</li>
    <li><strong>AA/Aa:</strong> Very high quality</li>
    <li><strong>A:</strong> High quality</li>
    <li><strong>BBB/Baa:</strong> Investment grade</li>
    <li><strong>BB/Ba:</strong> Non-investment grade (high yield)</li>
    <li><strong>B:</strong> More speculative</li>
    <li><strong>CCC/Caa:</strong> Substantial risks</li>
    <li><strong>CC:</strong> Extremely speculative</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major Agencies:</strong> Moody's, S&P (Standard & Poor's), Fitch</p>

<h4>Financial Statements and Financial Analysis</h4>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Public companies issue annual and interim financial statements showing the health of a company.</p>

<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Shows revenue, expenses, and profits</li>
    <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Shows assets, liabilities, and equity</li>
    <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Shows movement of cash in and out</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Metrics from Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Money coming in</li>
    <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Money going out (not including tax, interest, depreciation, amortization)</li>
    <li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Revenue minus expenses</li>
    <li><strong>Net Profit:</strong> Revenue minus all expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization</li>
    <li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization (often used for comparisons)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Financial Statements Matter:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Help companies make purchasing and corporate decisions</li>
    <li>Help investors evaluate company value</li>
    <li>Help regulators ensure compliance (prevent money laundering, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Asset Depreciation</h4>

<p><strong>Concept:</strong> The cost of a depreciating asset is divided across multiple income statements for the asset's useful life.</p>

<p><strong>Depreciating Assets:</strong> Machinery, buildings, computers, vehicles, furniture, equipment, fixtures</p>

<p><strong>Why Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Cost not captured in single year's expenses (non-cash expense)</li>
    <li>Allows cost to be divided over multiple statements</li>
    <li>Matches cost of asset with revenue it generates</li>
    <li>Makes balance sheets healthier by diluting large asset values</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Laptop purchased in 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cost: £1,000</li>
    <li>Expected life: 5 years</li>
    <li>Salvage value: £250</li>
    <li>Annual depreciation: (£1,000 - £250) / 5 = £150/year</li>
    <li>Book value over time: £1,000 (2014) → £850 (2015) → £700 (2016) → £550 (2017) → £400 (2018) → £250 (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Company Share Metrics</h4>

<p><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong> Portion of company's profits allocated to each outstanding share.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Company ABC net income: £50 million</li>
    <li>Outstanding shares: 14 million</li>
    <li>Dividend paid: £0.50/share (£7 million total)</li>
    <li>EPS = £50m / 14m = £3.07</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E):</strong> Stock price divided by earnings per share.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Stock price: £22.24</li>
    <li>EPS: £3.07</li>
    <li>P/E Ratio: 7.24</li>
    <li>Interpretation: Investors pay £7.24 for every £1 of earnings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What P/E Indicates:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High P/E:</strong> Investors expect higher future earnings growth</li>
    <li><strong>Low P/E:</strong> Company may be undervalued or outperforming expectations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Return on Investment (ROI):</strong> Measures profitability of an investment.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial investment: £1,000</li>
    <li>Value after 2 years: £1,250</li>
    <li>Profit: £250</li>
    <li>ROI: 25%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Uses:</strong> Assess profitability of past expenditure, potential profitability of future investments, investment worthiness, investment comparisons</p>

<h4>Basel Framework</h4>

<p><strong>Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Formed in 1974 by central bank governors</li>
    <li>Original purpose: Enhance financial stability by improving banking supervision</li>
    <li>Current membership: 45 members from 28 countries</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Capital Adequacy:</strong> Minimum capital reserves a bank must maintain to absorb losses. Acts as protection for depositors.</p>

<h4>Basel I (1988)</h4>

<p><strong>Requirement:</strong> 8% ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets</p>

<p><strong>Risk Weights:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>0% Risk: Cash, central bank reserves, government debt</li>
    <li>10%: Public sector debt</li>
    <li>20%: Bank debt</li>
    <li>50%: Residential mortgages</li>
    <li>100% Risk: Private sector debt, real estate, equipment, capital instruments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Capital (Tier 1 or 2) ≥ 8% × Risk Weighted Assets</p>

<p><strong>Adoption:</strong> Standards adopted by 120+ countries</p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Broad risk weights are blunt instruments</li>
    <li>Doesn't account for newer securitized products and derivatives</li>
    <li>Doesn't account for diversification as risk management strategy</li>
    <li>Difficult for regulators to assess with opaque portfolio views</li>
    <li>Doesn't consider market risk</li>
</ul>

<h4>Basel I: Market Risk Amendment (1996)</h4>

<p><strong>Addition:</strong> Amendment to account for market risk in capital requirements</p>

<p><strong>Key Provision:</strong> Addresses risks from trading activities vs. holding loans</p>

<p><strong>Calculation Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Calculate VaR daily</li>
    <li>Or use "building block" approach: Calculate general market risk and specific security risk separately, then combine</li>
</ul>

<h4>Basel II (2004)</h4>

<p><strong>Structure:</strong> 3-pillar framework to replace original accord</p>

<p><strong>Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Credit risk capital</li>
    <li>Market risk capital (from 1996 amendment)</li>
    <li>Operational risk capital (new)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pillar 2: Supervisory Review and Internal Risk Assessment</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Regulators review bank's risk management</li>
    <li>Banks assess their own risk profiles</li>
    <li>Stress testing requirements</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pillar 3: Market Discipline via Disclosure</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Public disclosure of risks</li>
    <li>Transparency requirements</li>
    <li>Market enforces discipline through pricing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Credit Risk Innovation:</strong> Banks could use external credit ratings or internal risk categorizations for capital calculations.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> When Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, it became clear Basel II was inadequate. Basel committee noted:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lehman had too much leverage</li>
    <li>Inadequate liquidity buffers</li>
    <li>Poor governance and risk management</li>
    <li>Inappropriate incentive structures</li>
</ul>

<h4>Basel III (2010+)</h4>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Created in response to 2008 financial crisis to strengthen capital framework</p>

<p><strong>Key Enhancements:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Higher capital requirements overall</li>
    <li>Higher quality capital required</li>
    <li>Liquidity requirements added (LCR, NSFR)</li>
    <li>Leverage ratio requirement</li>
    <li>Countercyclical capital buffer</li>
    <li>Systemically important bank surcharges</li>
</ul>

<h4>MiFID and ESMA</h4>

<p><strong>MiFID I (2004)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Markets in Financial Instruments Directive</li>
    <li>Applicable to European banks since 2007</li>
    <li>Primarily focused on equities</li>
    <li>Aim: Facilitate cross-border trading within EU</li>
    <li>Covers: Business conduct, authorization requirements, regulatory reporting, trade transparency</li>
    <li>Limitation: Became inadequate after 2008 crisis</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Began operating in 2009</li>
    <li>Independent EU authority accountable to European Parliament</li>
    <li>3 main objectives:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Investor protection</li>
        <li>Orderly markets</li>
        <li>Financial stability</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>MiFID II (2018)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive</li>
    <li>New Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MIFIR)</li>
    <li>More ambitious than MiFID I</li>
    <li>Effective January 3, 2018</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MiFID II Coverage:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>OTF (Organized Trading Facility) – captures unregulated trades on non-regulated platforms</li>
    <li>Increased transparency, pre- and post-trade</li>
    <li>Commodity derivative position limits (reduce speculation)</li>
    <li>Rules for algorithmic and high-frequency trading</li>
    <li>Increased investor protection requirements</li>
    <li>Expanded transaction reporting</li>
</ul>

<h4>EMIR Reporting</h4>

<p><strong>European Market Infrastructure Regulation (2012)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Applies to:</strong> All types of derivative contracts (interest rates, FX, credit, equities, commodities)</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Parties in ANY derivative contract must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Report every contract to a trade repository (TR)</li>
    <li>Clear applicable trades via a central counterparty (CCP)</li>
    <li>Implement new risk management standards for bilateral OTC derivatives not cleared</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>LEI (Legal Entity Identifier):</strong> Identifies companies in financial transactions</li>
    <li><strong>UTI (Unique Trade Identifier):</strong> Identifies each derivative trade</li>
</ul>

<h4>Central Counterparty Clearing</h4>

<p><strong>Counterparty Credit Risk:</strong> In every trade, both parties risk the other party defaulting.</p>

<p><strong>Solution: Central Counterparty (CCP)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>CCP sits between two parties of trade</li>
    <li>Acts as trade guarantor</li>
    <li>Example: CME Group</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Benefit: Multilateral Netting</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Consolidates all transactions with a client into one transaction</li>
    <li>Simplifies outstanding exposures</li>
    <li>Reduces complexity of bilateral trades</li>
    <li>Reduces settlement risk</li>
</ul>

<h4>FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act)</h4>

<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2010</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Promote cross-border tax compliance, reveal US persons' foreign accounts</p>

<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Implements Common Reporting Standard (CRS) for automatic exchange of information</li>
    <li>At least 96 countries share information on residents' assets and incomes</li>
    <li>Tax withholding can be used if reporting not provided</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Biggest burden on Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs)</p>

<h4>The Dodd-Frank Act</h4>

<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2010 – The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Decrease risk in US financial system in response to 2008 crisis</p>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Approximately 2,300 pages of provisions phased in over multiple years</p>

<p><strong>New Agencies Established:</strong> Created several new agencies to oversee financial system and prevent future crises</p>

<h4>The Volcker Rule</h4>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Part of Dodd-Frank, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prevent banks from acting like hedge funds</p>

<p><strong>Prohibition:</strong> Banks cannot trade with their own funds (proprietary trading) for their own profits</p>

<p><strong>Also Prohibits:</strong> Banks from owning hedge funds or private equity funds</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Stemmed from banks taking on complex, high-risk positions and losing. Example: Bear Stearns' hedge fund division made bad real estate bets, leading to bank collapse in 2008.</p>

<h4>Compliance in Banks</h4>

<p><strong>Role of Compliance:</strong> Translate new rules into procedures and advise business. Each business area has dedicated compliance team.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Monitor deal sizes, market impact, counterparties involved, trading mandates, recording agreements</li>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Establish controls to prevent rule violations</li>
    <li><strong>Checking:</strong> Verify compliance with all rules and procedures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example - Sales and Trading Compliance:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor deal sizes and market impact</li>
    <li>Verify counterparties approved for trading</li>
    <li>Ensure trading within authorized mandates</li>
    <li>Record all client agreements</li>
    <li>Monitor electronic trading systems for violations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Regulation is extensive and constantly evolving</li>
    <li>Multiple layers of regulation must be complied with</li>
    <li>Basel framework forms foundation of capital requirements</li>
    <li>Risk management is critical—VaR, stress testing, credit analysis</li>
    <li>Regulatory compliance is every employee's responsibility</li>
    <li>Future regulations will likely continue to expand</li>
